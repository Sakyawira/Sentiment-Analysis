# Epic Games Store Sentiment Analysis

## Business Case
My Business case is a particular game company wishes to investigate the popularity of Epic Games Store. The video game company plans to use the results of the investigation to inform future business decisions (whether they will make an exclusivity deal with Epic Games Store for their upcoming title). We approached the problem by analysing sentiments of posts in the Epic Games Store subreddit (r/EpicGamesPC: https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/ ).

## Data Collection
Data collection is done using the Reddit API. PushShift API was also used to bypass the 1000 submissions limit of the Reddit API. A total of 9727 posts are collected, and from those, 64311 comments are collected.

## Data Exploration
A word-cloud was used to illustrate the most common words in the whole data-frame. An interesting thing to note is that the word "Steam" in the top 5 words across the entire data-frame.

## Data Cleaning
Characters that do not help with prediction are discarded. Characters like \n, \t, might link two words together and make them indistinguishable from one another. Furthermore, any links are also discarded.

## Analysis
- ### __Positive / Negative Sentiments Ratio__
Using the Textblob package, we can see that the Epic Games Store Reddit has a mixed sentiment response on posts, with 36% bad sentiments and 63% good sentiment.

When using the self-trained classification model, there seem to be more Negative sentiments compared to Positive onesâ€”23% Negative response and 18% Positive sentiments. But if we set aside the Neutral Sentiments, this looks like a very mixed sentiment.

- ### Analysing Compound Sentiment Score Overtime
We grouped the compound score generated by the Vader package by month. We find both the sum and the average of each month's scores. Despite still being in the low-positive average score, the sentiments of the Epic Games Store seem to rise steadily over the one and half year it has been around.

## Conclusion
It is safe to conclude that despite their rough start, Epic Games Store's sentiment continues to rise to the positive side. Therefore, it is worth a try for the game company to distribute their title in Epic Games Store.
