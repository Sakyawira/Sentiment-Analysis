How Cybertruck has already saved a life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4utcz/how_cybertruck_has_already_saved_a_life/,"I've been meaning to share this story for a while now, but am just now getting around to writing it up and posting it. It is a big long, but I hope you enjoy it. This is my story about how the Cybertruck has already saved a life (or more accurately saved one almost immediately after it was revealed.

The story starts a little over a year ago; when we took delivery of our Model 3. I had been following Tesla for year and was 20th in line to reserve a Model 3 three years prior, but circumstances prevented us from getting it when we first got our email. Well on April 1st 2019 we were finally able to justify the down payment with a new job and a long daily commute for taking the kids to school and we picked up our car. My wife, while skeptical at the time, thought it was a good choice just given the gas savings (we were spending >$400/month in gas). She wasn't so sure she would like the car, especially given that she would be the one driving it 95% of the time. Well, lo and behold, she loved it. It didn’t have as many technical issues that she thought it would have given the technology in it and she got to the point where she hated having to drive our other vehicle. The Model 3 just made her daily commute so much easier and she never had to deal with stopping for gas, let alone doing it twice a week or more.

Flash forward 3 months. My wife has been loving the car and has even been using it to do Uber/Lyft to make some extra money. She didn’t do this often as she has never liked being around strangers and gets bad anxiety, but occasionally she would get in the mood to do some driving on the weekends or after dropping the kids off at school. Then summer hits.....

My wife's anxiety and stranger issues stem from her PTSD. She was abused physically and mentally for 11 years as a child at the hands of her stepfather while her mother stood by and did nothing. Even married the man AFTER my wife finally got out of the house, which didn’t make things better. Normally I can help her through her episodes but this time she was visiting a friend in another state when the episode hit and it was a bad one. Long story short, she ended up in a hospital and we had to fight the court to get her out. In the meantime she was pumped full of so much medicine that it completed f'ed any mental control she had. They gave her stuff I told them not to that sent her into cluster seizures and something that gave her extremely vivid nightmares for months. Thankfully we got her out within a week and I was able to get her back home, but she wasn’t the same person. We visited some local hospitals and found a local therapy place to try and help her but she had fallen into an extremely deep depression. For months I worried that every day may be the last day she was here and I did everything to remind her of what she had and try and bring her back. Her doctor worked with us to play with some medicine to at least stabilize her mood swings which were uncontrollable the entire time, but it wasn't a fast process and at least 3-4 times a week she would have terrible meltdowns.

After about 4 months we were able to get her medicine mostly figured out while she continued to go to weekly therapy sessions and she was at least somewhat stable. She only had issues maybe once per week, but was still in a very deep depression and I continued to worry every day that something could go wrong and I would lose her.

November 21st, 2019........

My wife as sleeping. She spent most of her time sleeping when I was home. That was her usual when she was in a depressions, but it was better than the alternative sometimes. I had gotten the kids to bed and was playing some games while waiting for the Cybertruck reveal. My wife knew we were planning to get the truck even before the reveal, but didn't really care. She knew a truck would be much more useful and would get us on all Tesla vehicles, but she really wanted an x even though we couldn’t afford it in the configuration we would need for traveling. I knew the truck was going to be a controversial design and sure enough when I saw it I wasn’t super impressed. I thought the design was interesting but wasn’t immediately something that I was drawn too. I thought it was neat but it wasn’t something amazing. Nonetheless, the next morning I decided to show my wife while we were lying in bed, but not quite ready to get up.

Cue the awakening.....

When my wife saw the truck come out, she was stunned; she absolutely loved the design! I don’t know why; I don’t think she knew why, but she fell in love with the truck. She no longer wanted the X, she wanted our next car to be the Cybertruck. She spent the next several hours watching and re-watching the reveal video and looking at every detail of the truck. Seeing how she reacted to it, I realized an opportunity and went downstairs to put in our reservation for the truck. I printed out the email and showed it to her and she was ecstatic for the first time in 4 months. It was like the old her came back out for the first time. I told her she needed to help save for it and she jumped at the opportunity. She put together charts and motivational pictures and started driving for Uber again with our 3. She has completely changed since that moment she saw the truck and is back to her old self. She has been saving money so we can get the truck as soon as our name comes up and has has a complete turnaround form constant depression to excited giddiness since that day in November. She has been following everything that comes out about the truck, has replaced her favorite hat with a Tesla hat, and gets into excited conversations about the truck with other Tesla owners when we are charging (took a trip across country since the reveal).

This past 9 months has been an amazing time for us as she's gotten back to her old self and she's been working hard to save as much as possible. We've had some setbacks (corona, our 3 getting totaled (just replaced with a y)), but still have saved up a good amount and vie since had a good pay increase so I am helping her by sending money every paycheck into the savings account. All I can say is ""Thank You Tesla"". The Cybertruck probably saved my wife's life, our family, and my sanity.",347,2020-08-07 04:22:11,3

"Constant ""Charging Interrupted"" with Gen 3 Wall Charger (solution)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i52837/constant_charging_interrupted_with_gen_3_wall/,"I LOVE my brand new 2020 S100D long range and was excited to get a brand new wall charger professionally installed so that I might actually be able to drive it! For the first few weeks I had zero problem with the charger, but after a couple of updates it now will interrupt charging 4-5 times a night. It's a pain, and I've seen this posted all over reddit and the Tesla owners forums, but the solutions they all tried (check for loose wires, etc.) did not work for me, so I opened a ticket with Tesla.

Did you know your wall charger has a wifi adapter in it? I didn't. The technician has informed me that this is a known issue with this particular firmware version, and that an updated firmware should resolve the issue. The wall charger is overheating, which is why some have had success by turning down the charging rate (Mine is at 48Amps). 

The solution is to use the QR code in the quickstart manual as well as the password to connect to the wall charger's wifi network (kind of like an Amazon echo does) and configure the wifi on the wall charger. Within a couple of hours of being unplugged from the car it will download the latest firmware which should fix the issue. I thought I would post this here in case anyone else is having the same problem.",24,2020-08-07 10:54:59,8
Cross Country Trip in Model Y,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i57c6m/cross_country_trip_in_model_y/,"We’re moving across the country (CA to NY) late Sept/early Oct. With everything going on, we’re weighing the options of driving across the country in our Model Y (versus flying) and thinking of camping out in the back (versus limiting the hotel stays along the way).  Not sure if this will be a bad idea or not. 

Has anyone done a road trip across the country since the pandemic has started? Are the super charging stations pretty reliable to make it all the way across? Is the WiFi reliable enough to work from in the car/take VC calls? Any light weight camping setups that won’t take up all of the back seat? Would the mini fridge be a bad idea?Any other advice or tips? 

We fortunately are not time or budget crunched but mainly want to avoid as much exposure as possible along the trip.",7,2020-08-07 16:30:07,9
Tesla Model Y RWD Delivery Text Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4ytm2/tesla_model_y_rwd_delivery_text_update/,"I just got a text from Tesla saying my Model Y RWD would be ready in 5-8 weeks. It also said I could get a different model sooner. So I don't know if its true that it'll be ready in 5-8 weeks or if they are just trying to get me to buy an AWD. 

My Model Y Reservation is White and the rear bumper mismatch color really bugs me. I was tracking it when it was a problem with the 3 and I hope it gets resolved. My reservation is still the $2,500 one right before the hiked FSD from $6,000 to $7,000. 

Based on the price reduction and if the RWD gets priced at $45k, it should come out to nearly the same price with FSD at $8k if I just cancel it and change the color. Just waiting on hard numbers before canceling my $2,500 reservation. 

I really wanted a white Y to go with my black 3.


Update: just got another text saying it was an error.",22,2020-08-07 07:50:32,10
"Having an absolute terrible time with the service centre, is there anything I can do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i50s3i/having_an_absolute_terrible_time_with_the_service/,"Dropped the car off for a HW3 upgrade in the morning, on the phone prior, I was told it would take 2 hours tops.

When I arrived, I had intended to wait for the car to be upgraded, about an hour later, they informed me that they were having difficulty with the install and that it wouldn’t be ready until 3pm. They also told me that they have no loaner available, and so they can provide me with Uber credits to get back to work. I took the Uber credits and went back to work. 

At 3pm, I had heard nothing from them so I decided to call and was told that the update to the software kept failing and that it wasn’t going to be ready until 5pm. I asked if they could call me at 430 and let me know if I should leave to come and get it.

They called and said that I should start making my way over. So I leave work and get on the highway; which is now rush hour traffic, I get about 20 minutes into the drive only for them to call back and tell me that the update failed again, and that they are closing for the night.

They claim it is due to the wifi in their service centre being poor and they will try to push the update as they are leaving so no one will be on the network, but that they have to keep the car overnight. So I ask the Uber to return me home, and I gotta say I’m pretty upset. What was suppose to be a 2 hour service appointment has now turned into me not having a vehicle for at least 24 hours, assuming the update even occurs and the car is ready for pickup tomorrow at 9.

I have a family and had to arrange for children to be picked up from their grandparents, I will also have to arrange for them to be dropped off tomorrow at their grandparents, as I’m not gonna send them in an Uber...

Coincidentally, I was supposed to go to a “drive in concert” for A Tribe Called Red in Toronto tonight, it starts at 7pm, an hour and a half, and I am frantically trying to find a friend whose car i can borrow as I will need a car for the show, or I’m out of luck with even going...

I know perhaps it was foolish to book a service centre upgrade to my FSD and a drive in concert on the same day, but it just worked out that way. Had the FSD appointment for a month, and the concert tickets were bought a week ago... figured it wouldn’t be an issue given that the FSD upgrade in everyone else experience only takes about an hour and a half...

So yea... that’s my story... any thoughts? I’m pretty frustrated...

Is there anything I can do?",13,2020-08-07 09:35:01,11
Stolen Side View Mirror - Warning,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4z65n/stolen_side_view_mirror_warning/,"I just got a Model X a few weeks ago after finally trimming quite a bit of fat from my budget.  I was indescribably angry to find my left (driver's) side view mirror had been stolen in NYC sometime between 2am and 8:15am on 3-Aug-2020. The thief stole only the glass part of the mirror, and was able to pop it off without damaging the 3 wires (please see picture). The dealer where I just bought it  said I would have to replace the entire component ($675, plus $195/hour labor + tax = $946).  I'm looking into fixing it myself by sourcing the part online or heading to auto parts shops in the area.

Does anyone have any prevention tips so I don't run into this in the future? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated, including any tips you may have regarding pursuit of justice.  Sentry Mode captured video of (presumably) everyone who triggered the proximity sensors:  mostly joggers, garbage men & other passersby but no one close to the mirror.  Around 7am it also captured 65 minutes of video of workers gathering at the job site next to my car arriving for work, waiting around, and then climbing up scaffolding.  It captured a lot of clear video of faces which could help identify the thief, but nothing that clearly shows someone stealing the mirror.  Similarly, I've looked at security camera footage from a few stores & apt buildings but I haven't found anything yet which captures the crime being committed.  I mentioned Sentry Mode but the cops said ""we're not going to be able to do anything"" without even looking at the videos that were captured.  I said thanks for taking the report -- for my insurance and also for CompStat to have the data to record the crime -- and off they went.

A quick google search indicates this crime has been on the rise for a few years, so I'm posting as a warning to other Tesla owners (and, I guess, all other car owners with similar tech in the mirrors like auto dim, sensors, and motors).  Before they left, the cops said there are dozens of auto parts stores (chop shops) less than a mile away in the Hunts Point section of the south Bronx, as well as across the East River in Queens.  Thieves can pop the mirrors off in <5 seconds with a flathead screwdriver, go to the chop shop, and get anywhere from $20 to $150 per mirror depending on type, condition, etc.

"Powerwall as a backup system for outages, but without solar",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4xf6h/powerwall_as_a_backup_system_for_outages_but/,"With the multi-day power outage in NJ, we’ve been considering backup systems to be better prepared for next time. We actually had some discussions ongoing with our contractor about installing a whole-house 20 kW natural gas generator when the storm hit. I didn’t know much about Tesla Powerwall, but reading about it more makes it sound like an interesting alternative. I’m not sure if I’m thinking about this the right way, so could use some advice.

Looking at electricity bills, our average daily consumption is 37 kWh in the summer and 18 kWh in the winter. The summer consumption includes a central AC maintained at 73-75 F throughout the day. Most of our other heavy appliances (dryer, water heater, steam boiler) are gas-powered, and we don’t have a well or sump pumps. I expect our usage during an outage will be much lower than either of these numbers since we only need to operate lights, fans (at night) and small electronic devices for the most part, and can easily survive without AC. Installing 2 Powerwalls will give us 25-26 kWh of total capacity and 10 kW of power, which seems sufficient for a 2-3 day outage.

The total installed cost for the Powerwalls is $17k + tax, which is incidentally almost exactly the same as what was quoted for the natural gas generator (it needs breaking up our back patio and digging up our lawn, not a simple installation). While the generator gives us unlimited capacity and double the power, the lack of noise or maintenance and freedom of location for the Powerwalls is a big draw for me, especially given our consumption and the fact that outages happen maybe once or twice a year. For longer outages, we plan to have a small portable gas powered generator available to use in the worst case.

Adding solar to the Powerwalls actually brings the total cost down to $14k (credits + bundle discount), but I’m not a big fan of having solar panels on our beautiful hundred year old slate roof. We also have very heavy tree cover, so it’s unlikely they will provide much value. My husband still wants to consider them, but I wanted to make sure that the Powerwalls are not a terrible decision even without solar.

I Turo’d a Model S P100DL - My Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4tsov/i_turod_a_model_s_p100dl_my_experience/,"After surely getting sick of me ranting and raving about Tesla’s at nearly every chance I get, my family surprised me with an awesome gift- the rental of a fully loaded P100D with FSD. The host was amazing as was the car and experience as a whole. This wasn’t my first time driving a PxDL Tesla, but I hadn’t for anything longer than minutes till now.

However, I don’t think it pushed me towards being a customer. (get your downvotes ready) my car background- I have an attachment to bmws that I can’t help. I don’t seek them out but they’ve given me exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted twice in a row, and seem to have my number this time around, too. I used to own a 650i, then sold it, went car-less for a while and picked up a 328i which was meant to be somewhat temporary, but has ended up serving me quite well save for missing some stuff I’d like, namely TACC and more power. A family member has an M3 (bmw, not model 3) which I drive fairly frequently. I casually have my eyes on a used 90D to retrofit with ap3, the bmw m550, and the Mercedes e43 AMG. I view the 3 of them as being in the same general territory. I love Tesla and the idea of owning an electric car but I’m not married to it. And I’m very picky, perhaps too picky for a Tesla at this time.

The good:

- It goes without saying at, but its acceleration is sublime. It’s literally heart-stopping and a joy to drive. There’s nothing else like it.
- Its overall road feel is also completely on point. The ride is just stiff enough to be fun but still comfortable. It handles in a way that lets you mostly (but not completely) forget about its size and weight.
- I think it’s the best-looking car on the road. I love its design. It hasn’t changed much in around 8 years and yet it always has me turning my head.
- The body style, large hatchback, is perfect. I wish more automakers embraced it. The only similar ones are the Audi A7, Porsche Panamera and discontinued BMW Gran Turismo. And none of them are executed as well as the Tesla when it comes to utilizing space.
- So much cargo space. More than small and even mid-sized SUV’s.
- I love the regenerative braking. It’s very easy to control one’s speed, both up and down.

The okay:
- I found the front seats to be pretty good. It’s one of the rare ones that has ventilated seats, and while they aren’t the best, they actually do do what they’re supposed to, which is whisk sweat off your back to prevent your shirt from sticking to them. But my family’s opinions were mixed. Overall they’re similar, maybe a little lower in comfort to the ones found in 3-series/C-Class/A4 etc. Not at the level of higher-end premium seats.
- Autosteer veered out of its lane several times. I don’t feel too comfortable relying on it. I don’t mind steering though, but I find TACC critical. And it’s very good in that regard. (But competing luxury sedans are pretty competitive here)
- I don’t want to diminish how exhilarating it is to drive, but there’s a limit to how much acceleration one can typically make use of. Like many of you I probably see during my daily commute, I spend a decent chunk of time in stop and go traffic on the 101, and no amount of hp can put a dent in that. I drove the (BMW) M3 home after dropping it off so that both cars’ feels were fresh in my mind. The Tesla was noticeably quicker to around 30, but from 50-100, it’s hard to feel a difference (or even get the opportunity), despite the bmw being objectively slower. Tesla in ludicrous+, bmw in sport+. 
- There’s a notion that Tesla’s are untouchable in a straight line, which isn’t far off, but the likes of the Mercedes e63 and bmw m5 are competitive in price, size and even raw speed numbers. I wish I had been able to try one of those back-to-back with the Tesla.

The not so good:
- The rear seats are terrible. There’s no sugar coating it. They’re essentially seat cushions bolted directly to the floor, presumably because the battery is directly below them. They aren’t even suitable for average sized adults on anything but short trips. Lack of bolsters makes things worse. 
- The cargo capacity is complete overkill yet the rear of the cabin is not as spacious as you’d expect given the size of the car. Makes me wonder if they could’ve somehow traded some the former for the latter.
- No cup holders in the back. Nor side pockets on the door. Highly inconvenient. Was not fun for my rear passenger holding a cup of coffee getting flung around on the rear bench seats (my gunning the car certainly didn’t help, and for that I’m to blame)
- Despite the lack of engine noise, the road noise on the highway is pretty high. We found ourselves yelling to carry a conversation. My BMW’s sound damping is much better. It’s also not very composed, it shakes noticeably past around 80, and you can hear the body panels vibrating. Cars literally 5x cheaper wouldn’t be expected to suffer from this.
- I really missed being able to open the trunk by swiping my leg as is common on other sedans and suvs. Instead, I had to fumble with the key fob with both hands full of groceries.
- The traffic visualization is pretty cool. But it’s not as effective as a 360 camera coupled with traditional blind spot monitoring. The owner of the car said he swiped one of the rims due to misjudging the width of the car. I understand some patent/licensing issues prevent Tesla from adding a 360 camera view. It’s too bad, because the lack of it is conspicuous and a frequent complaint.
- I find the infotainment system pretty nice. But the lack of responsiveness of the touch screen coupled with its position make it inconvenient and unsafe to use while driving. The steering wheel controls mostly get the job done.
- I don’t own a home. Having to use superchargers was frustrating. I live in the Bay Area, but it was still a challenge to find, say, a supercharger with a nearby Starbucks to kill time. I don’t think I could get used to this, especially on road trips. Both my apartment building and workplace have chargers, though.
- The fit and finish is a tired complaint, but I do think it’s fair game, along with the lack of convenience features, considering that this car cost as much a decent house in some parts of the us.  Other sport luxury cars in this class have better appointed interiors, though I understand that’s not that important for many.
- Another common item for the wishlist - a HUD.

Overall, there were so many things I absolutely loved, but there were also several things I couldn’t forgive. What frustrates me is that Tesla accomplished incredible things and solved extremely tough, unsolved, problems along the way. Yet, they didn’t solve problems that have been solved by other automakers decades ago. Most of you won’t agree with me and that’s okay. The market has spoken, and it says that the pros outweigh the cons to a huge amount of people.

Overall, for the money, the right German ICE sedan seems to offer a similar level of performance, and even technology, with a lot more comfort, so I haven’t been weaned away from them yet.

I’m still definitely going to try a model 3 performance, as it looks like even more fun for a weekend, but I expect it to amplify many of my gripes.",11,2020-08-07 03:26:11,17

- What specific changes to their design, quality, and QC need to be addressed before it's ready for mass consumption?
- What specific changes to their supply and/or purchasing model need to be changed?

For my part, I'm normally an early adopter and love tinkering with the latest and greatest tech available, but it's too expensive for me to take on that risk with a car.  I personally will need to see them address some of the glaring QC issues that are still rampant (e.g. paint job), fix some of the minor QOL issues (e.g. the rain dripping into trunk, which is finally being covered), and the supply chain (I don't want to wait potentially months from the time I made my purchase, plus all the other horror stories about delays).

I realize I'm not the target audience for these cars at this time, but as Tesla matures I think they will have to address these issues if they want to compete with other mainstream car companies that are slowly catching up with their own designs.

I love thinking about the direction that Tesla could go in the future, and I'm curious to hear from others on how that might (or should) happen.",1,2020-08-07 06:33:39,22

Powerwall vs NG Generator,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4qngd/powerwall_vs_ng_generator/,"I, like many in NJ, lost power. I’ve been running a portable generator that I wheel out anytime there’s an outage and I’m ready for a more permanent solution. 

I know that PW will be less cost effective than a backup generator, and I’m ok with that, but I have some functionality questions. 

I am wondering if I buy 2-3 PWs if they would essentially operate as a backup generator. Here’s a bit about my situation:


- I have a 10.06kW PV system (not from Tesla). Last month it generated 1212 kWh. 

- Last month, likely my peak, I consumed 3200 kWh. (June was 2400).

- My heavy loads are inground pool (I never run heater in summer), AC, electric oven and Model 3.

- Have net metering in NJ (JCPL), not on TOU. This probably plays more into the financial side of things though. 

Would appreciate any thought or advice.",2,2020-08-07 00:08:54,25

Charging to 100% at superchargers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4sdqb/charging_to_100_at_superchargers/,"(Reposted with title not phrased as a question)

So am without power at home for 3 days now and my car is down below 30% so I figured it’s time to head to the supercharger. I have an SC less than 5 mikes from my house and I have rarely had a need to use it, but it sure is nice to have this convenience. But I digress. 

When I arrive a little after 9 am, all 8 stalls are occupied and there is one car waiting. With 8 stalls I figure the wait should only be a few minutes. 20 minutes later no one has left. Another 10 minutes and finally a car leaves so I NA next in line. Finally after a total of almost 45 minutes I get an open stall. 

As I plug in I glance at the screen of the the car next to me. The charging graphic is almost all green - he is definitely charging past 90%, looks like almost 100. The same appears to be the case in the car next to him and I am assuming that most of the others are charging that high. 

I suppose it is possible that they all started charging at the same time just minutes before I arrived but this seems unlikely. So I gave to believe most are charging past 90% and that’s why it took so long.

"Service center says ""Climate control odors are not covered under limited warranty"" for model 3",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i3re6e/service_center_says_climate_control_odors_are_not/,"Those of you who got the mildew AC smell covered under warranty, how did you do it? What did you say to the service center? It is annoying that some service centers will cover this problem and other service centers expect you to pay for it.

&#x200B;

I recently bought a used 2018 model 3.

Drove it for the first few months, when it started getting hotter where I live I began to blast the AC, something I did not try to do when test driving the car (my mistake, I know). 

But blasting the AC, my god. It smells like mold dipped in vinegar and left to bake in the sun for years. I found other tesla owners with the same problem have varying degrees of success. I have read that some people bring their model 3 into the service center and they were able to successfully solve the problem and have it covered under warranty.

&#x200B;

But others (like me) have been told that climate control odors are not covered under the warranty and had to either DIY solve the problem (buy air filters, buy the AC cleaner, open the panels, spray the cleaner, reinstall filters, etc.) or simply pay out of pocket for the problem (service center quoted me roughly $110)

&#x200B;

My understanding is that Tesla released a software update to help reduce the source of the mold smell - after parking and leaving your car the fan will turn on high for a while to remove any condensation or moisture left on the AC, which causes the mold smell.

&#x200B;

But apparently the cars that were affected before this update will still have the mold smell. 

&#x200B;

Since Tesla released a software update to fix the mold smell aren't they admitting that this problem is not due to user error and as such should be covered under warranty?

I'd rather not spend the money to DIY when I know this problem is not created due to user error. Any help?

Edit:
After sending another message that this is due to manufacturer defect, Tesla should cover under warranty, this is acknowledged by Tesla since they released a software update to fix, etc. They just replied the same ""unfortunately this is not covered under warranty message.""

They told me parts and labor cost for cabin filters was $65. 

The total cost for parts and labor for disinfecting the AC and replacing cabin filters was $120.

I asked if they could install 3rd party filters I bought to save me some money but they said they're unable to install 3rd party accessories.

I would go through with paying for this repair out of pocket if that meant they could then warranty their work.

Like if I pay them $120 now to remove the mold smell and the smell comes back in like a year or two I have to pay them another $120? I'd be fine paying this amount if they could warranty it and offer free repair for any future mold smell.

Edit 2:

I called and spoke to someone at the service center. They told me that the mold smell has never been covered under warranty (!?). They then said that mold smell falls under cabin filter maintenance which is something the customer always pays for.

I texted the service center and asked them if I pay for the repair and the smell comes back in a year or two would I have to pay them again? This was their response:

""It depends on when it returns. We've seen majority of them don't return, but there has been an occasion where after a year + it did, and is responsible by the customer. If it were to return within a very short period, we would have to present the detail to management for approval on covering the cost.""

Pretty frustrating, I guess I'll just cancel my appointment and DIY. Anyone know easy tools to lift up and pop out the panels that hide the evaporator oils?",60,2020-08-05 08:42:55,44

Installing Outdoor chargers in a condo community,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i3xcct/installing_outdoor_chargers_in_a_condo_community/,"Looking for any advice users with similar situations to mine.

My wife and I live in a condo community with no garages or isolated parking, instead there is a large common parking area, with a single assigned space per home. I've attached an image of our neighborhood for reference. Our home is the area highlighted in orange, our parking space highlighted green, and there are multiple power meters (including ours) outside in the area circled in red.

MY question is: How do I install a charger for our spot that's minimally invasive and will get past the Homeowners Association?

My thought was to do a small sub-panel off our power meter than tied to our charger (in blue on the image), but I'm not sure if that's even possible. Has anyone had experience with a similar install? 

I'm trying to avoid having to bring power all the way our from our unit, because that will likely be a mess. Then again, trenching and bringing power out to our parking space from the meters might also be a mess.

Any help is appreciated!

Driving During a Software Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i3csfv/driving_during_a_software_update/,"Hi all!  Thought I’d share some “undocumented” functionality I came across:

I just installed the 2020.28.26 update on my Model 3, and out of curiosity I decided to try starting the car with the mobile app (to bypass PIN to Drive) during the update.  To my surprise, it worked and I was able to drive away during the “Updating Autopilot” phase.  The screen remained unusable, displaying only the update UI.  After a short drive around my complex, I returned to my garage.  The car proceeded to the “Updating Electronic Control Units” phase almost immediately after I put it in park, and everything shut down.

I’m not sure if this is a bug, or an important fail safe feature, but either way it’s good to know.  Thoughts?

Edit:  As others have suggested, don’t try this.  I only did because I’m curious about how the software was designed to behave under unexpected conditions.  It would appear a lot of care was put into ensuring the car is capable of safely operating without the ICE computer at all",35,2020-08-04 16:31:53,56
What's the Ideal Charging Setup at Home for Cybertruck + Travel Trailer?,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i3mmla/whats_the_ideal_charging_setup_at_home_for/,"I just bought a Basecamp 20X which has a 120v, 30 AMP shore power connection. 

I have a Cybertruck reserved and expect to need to charge at home a few times per month, assuming they produce the solar panel vault cover and it actually does provide 10-15mi range per day. 

I want to install a charger/receptacle in my driveway to keep the Basecamp charged and be able to use it as an office with the ability to run the AC (needs shore power). 

Based on my limited knowledge, it looks like one type of outlet would not work for both, but that I'd need either an adapter for the trailer to use the Tesla charger outlet or vice versa. 

If that is true, what will I need to install and what would the best setup be? I also do not have any available breakers on my panel, so I am not sure if this will require a major panel upgrade.

As an aside - at this point with a pool, travel trailer, Tesla, and AC in the south it's looking like a conversion to solar is in my imminent future.",4,2020-08-05 04:36:26,57

Model 3 Fact-Finding - Air Conditioning Power Draw Measured,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i2j71z/model_3_factfinding_air_conditioning_power_draw/,"It doesn't get super hot where I live, but recently it hit 30°C and I took some measurements of the HVAC system under various cooling scenarios using CAN bus and API data.  Airflow was set to Face vent only and front seats only.  Tests were with the car stopped in Hold mode but in gear (daytime running lights on) and facing towards the sun for maximum sunload on the driver, intended to replicate a typical driving scenario but without the measurement instability that that incurs.  I also performed a driving test which showed that driving doesn't significantly alter the amount of power the HVAC draws, at least while using the AC component.  In extreme deltas between cabin and ambient temperature the car body itself may still have a higher conductive effect when driving due to increased airflow over the glass.

##Baseline

https://imgur.com/mc09B52

The baseline power draw of Model 3 in this configuration with fans/HVAC stopped was about 0.45 kW.  The HV Battery measurements are the total power drawn from the high-voltage battery terminals, while the DC-DC converter output represents only the draw of the 12V systems (computers, lights, fans).  The compressor runs on high-voltage DC while the radiator and cabin fans are low-voltage.  The DC conversion process is about 95% efficient, and the 12V battery contribution is insignificant while the DC-DC converter is active.

##Test 1: Set Temp 20°C, Re circulation Off

https://imgur.com/WRjNdBh

Testing was preceded with a manual fan speed of 5 to ensure the starting cabin temperature was stable.  Despite the set temperature being almost 10°C lower than the outside ambient air, the air will still pass over the PTC cabin heater and some power will be used to dehumidify and correct the temperature to match the requested temp.  This leads to the unexpected result that the system may draw more power in order to cool the cabin using a set temperature than to cool it using Lo.  There's also correspondingly higher radiator RPM required to remove heat from the loop when the system is drawing in fresh hot air.  

The fan speed was cycled down from 10 to 1 at one minute intervals.  Beginning at fan speed 10 showed a total peak draw of almost 7 kW and steady-state draw of 5-6 kW.  All of the speeds had no problems maintaining the cabin at the 20°C set point, and the lowest draw was observed at fan speeds 2 & 1, where total system draw was 1.2 kW.  This was enough airflow to keep the cabin temperature sensor stable at the set temp but not enough airflow to be comfortable if you're facing the sun.  At speed 6, which I'd consider perfectly adequate for cooling the driver, the total draw was about 2.5-3 kW (2-2.5 kW over baseline).

##Test 2: Set Temp 20°C, Re circulation On

https://imgur.com/JcIhzYV

The same test process, except with cabin air re-circulation enabled.  This allows already cooled cabin air to re-enter the system and reduces demand on the AC.

Steady-state draw at fan speed 10 was only 3 kW, and at speeds 8 and below it was under 2 kW.  At a very reasonable fan speed of 6 the total draw was 1.5 kW, at speeds 4 and under it was 1.0 kW, or only 0.5 kW over the baseline.  

##Test 3: Set Temp Lo, Re circulation On

https://imgur.com/3TfrtUh

Setting the temp to Lo causes it to use an internal set point of 15°C, but more importantly it seems to disable the PTC cabin heater entirely.  There was no spiky behavior in power draw, and the cabin was able to reach about 15.5°C internally despite the 30°C outside temperature and direct sunlight into the cabin.  At speeds 6 and below the total draw was about 1.1 kW, or only 0.6 kW over the baseline with HVAC off.  Again, all fan speeds were able to keep the cabin air temperature below 20°C, with the amount of air flow being up to driver's preference

##Test 4: Auto

https://imgur.com/Z7TWNJe

When set to Auto, re circulation will usually be enabled unless the humidity gets too high.  This test was preceded by an uncomfortable 7 minutes of no HVAC to let the cabin heat-soak up to about 28°C.  

Starting on Auto and Lo, the car drew up to 5 kW initially and settled at around 2.5 kW and fan speed 9.  The internal temperature only took 2 minutes to come down and actually undershot the low temp mark by a few degrees (explained by the evaporator's internal set point of around 2-5°C), so with the high airflow being maintained the cabin has no problems cooling down.

Switching to Auto and 20°C, the system quickly settled at fan speed 4 and 1.0 kW total system draw (0.5 kW over baseline).

##Test 5: Driving, Outside 25°C, Set Temp 20°C, Auto

https://imgur.com/00pSnwT

It's hard to isolate the HVAC system power draw while driving due to the massive variance in power consumption by the motors, but I attempted to by driving on the same stretch of highway at a fixed cruise control speed of 105 km/h and ensured no cars were in front of me to provide drafting or slow me down.  Runs were back to back about 15 minutes apart to ensure closest possible ambient temp and wind conditions.  

Fan speed was fixed at 5 on both tests.  The massive swings in consumption are due to the elevation changes on the chosen stretch of road, but the difference in average consumption over 2 minutes of driving with AC on and off worked out to be 0.51 kW, the same as was seen with the stationary tests when re-circulation is enabled.",233,2020-08-03 08:34:07,73

Could you share your Tesla return experiences (before AND/OR during COVID-19),https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i33sp5/could_you_share_your_tesla_return_experiences/,"I have been leasing ICE cars for years and the return process is as follow:

**Before COVID**

* I can make appointment with any dealer and drop-off the car
* For some brand, I have to make appointment with AutoVIN to do pre-assessment and once a report is issued by AutoVIN, bring the car to any dealer
* Most brands are very accommodating on wear and tear. E.g. if you have  scratch but it's less than the size of a credit card, Mercedes won't mind.

**During COVID**

My car lease is not up yet, but will be soon. Based on what I gather, the return experience have not been so good. Example:

* Some dealerships will not take the return and I have to hunt down which one is which (none so far)
* My financial service (the one that provide the lease) said that I can just extend the lease until dealerships start taking lease return again - bad option IMHO since I do not want to keep the car anymore and it's a liability for me in case something happen with the car.

So just want to get your experience on Tesla lease return since Tesla does not have 3rd party dealership, especially:

* How easy it is to do a lease return
* If Tesla require the use of AutoVIN or any other pre-inspection
* How accommodating Tesla on wear and tear.

Got to drive a model 3 for the first time.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i26oe3/got_to_drive_a_model_3_for_the_first_time/,"For some background, I work as an auto technician working on gasoline engines, and I love what I do. I've always been the kind of guy that says ""I don't get electric cars. Where's the fun? I want the engine"". I had a customer being in a 2018 Model 3 into my shop for some tires, and I ended up having to test drive it. At first, it was crazy. I had no clue how to start it, no clue how to drive it, no clue about anything other than the suspension, tires, and brakes. It was surprisingly intuitive. The way it drove felt like nothing I've ever driven before. It was it's own vehicle. The way the accelerator felt and how responsive the steering was, was mind blowing. The comfort was also fairly surprising. I obviously didn't do any crazy acceleration, but I could tell it was ready to go whenever I was. The sound system in it was surprisingly clear and crisp, the display was super responsive and easy to navigate. I've gotta say, I'm now a believer that electric cars are the future. I still think they've got a good ways to go before they're the standard, but I believe it will happen. Elon has the right idea. I'm actually somewhat tempted to buy a Model 3 in the future once my financial situation is improved. The price is honestly surprising. All that for only 30k? That's ridiculous. My only concern is reliability over time. I know the average life of a gasoline vehicle is roundabout 200k miles. I have yet to personally see a Tesla over 80k. I'm not sure if that's due to how new they are or not, but I've heard there may be reliability issues. But then again, Elon also states that they are designed to go over 1m miles.

Model 3 performance that isn't performance.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i266ga/model_3_performance_that_isnt_performance/,"Today I test drove a model 3 performance and decided to buy it.  The sales guy said they had some inventory on the way from the factory if I wanted a car asap, which I do.

He says the cars are all performance, but they are ""self performance"", or at least I think thats what he says.  He says its a performance car, but without the performance extras.  On the tesla website it calls it a performance, but it has the regular wheels and a longer range.

Price is the same as a M3 performance though.

So what is this and is it a good deal?",19,2020-08-02 16:25:09,95

I upgraded to that version quickly from a previous version so not sure if this is the first time I noticed the issue or if it happened on the previous update.

Maybe 20+ miles/day. I haven't monitored it consistently. This is only day 3 with this version, but I lost maybe 7 miles over an hour long dinner. I did charge overnight last night, but problem continues today.

I know this used to be an off and on issue back in 2017ish, but since I got my Model 3 I have not really seen many reports of this issue. I live in the south, so it's pretty hot now, not sure if it is trying to actively cool when asleep.

Any troubleshooting ideas? Or just hope to get a new update pushed soon?

Looking for any ideas/suggestions.  I had the HW3 swap done on my Model 3 a couple weeks ago.  Immediately after, I noticed that the LTE data reception was almost always reporting very low signal, and commonly losing connection all together.  I live in a very developed area and have no reception issues under normal circumstances - In fact I never had any reception issues with my Model 3 until after the HW3 swap.

I tried scheduling mobile service to take a look, but all I got was a text that they were investigating from their end and that there wasn't anything that the mobile tech could do.  I could try scheduling another service, this time at the service center I guess.. but I wanted to see if anyone else had experienced anything like this.  Did they just forget to plug back in the LTE antenna cable during the hardware swap or something?",16,2020-07-31 23:58:14,127

"I agonized for several months between the SR+ and LR, before finally forcing myself to go with the cheaper option. I have not regretted it at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i0s1bj/i_agonized_for_several_months_between_the_sr_and/,"I had followed Tesla for years, but around January of 2020 I decided to take a Model 3 for a test drive, as my trusty old Corolla was starting to show its age given its 220,000+ miles. 

The Tesla bug hit me hard, I watched probably hundreds of Model 3 videos and read everything I could. I decided to wait until March or so to buy, as my Corolla wasn't dying or anything quite yet and I needed to save up money. Then COVID hit, so I decided to wait some more to make sure my job was relatively secure before committing to buying a new car. 

Two factors finally pushed me over the edge in June - interest rates dropping so low, and the $2k price cut Tesla implemented. But for all those months, I had been completely agonizing over whether to stick with the SR+, or to stretch my budget another $9k and go for the LR-AWD. I had major FOMO about the better specs, sound system, and of course range anxiety over the lesser range of the SR+. You can see my posts about it on this very subreddit. Yet ultimately I forced myself to make the slightly better financial decision (still not the best, the best would have been driving the Corolla til the wheels fell off lol) and went with the SR+, though I anticipated massive buyers remorse. 

Well, one month in to owning an SR+, and I need not have worried. The acceleration is fun as hell to me, especially coming off 13 years in a basic economy car, I can't believe I was worried it would feel too slow. The sound system is fantastic to my ears though maybe I'll just make sure to not find out what the LR-AWD sounds like haha. 

Finally, my biggest concern, range, is simply not an issue at all, even though I have a long-ish work commute of about 48 miles round trip each day. I charge to 70% to preserve battery life, and still come home with usually over 45% remaining. The longest ""routine"" trip I make is once or twice a month I visit my parents in San Diego, 110 miles away. On those days I charge the car to 90%, arrive at my parents with around 35-45% remaining (which is enough to do any local driving we need), and then just stop by the Del Mar supercharger for 20 minutes on the way back, which has been nearly empty both times I went to it**\***.

I take maybe one long road trip per year to Arizona, Yosemite, etc, so yes, that will require an extra stop or two. But those road trips are leisurely vacation trips, and I don't mind the extra stop. If I am in a hurry traveling for business, I would just fly anyway. 

**Tl;Dr -** The SR+ is a fine choice and you probably will not regret getting it, especially considering the money that is saved. If money is not a big concern, then sure, get the LR-AWD or even the Performance for the better specs. Alternatively, if you are regularly driving over 150 miles a day such that regular charging stops would get annoying, then sure get the LR-AWD for that. Otherwise, if you are like me, you will be having too much fun to worry about any FOMO. This is especially true if, like me, you are coming off a boring car. I could see why someone used to BMWs and such may need a higher-end Tesla to really impress them with its performance, but that was not my previous situation and I'm having a blast.

(Probably will crosspost to the Model 3 subreddit)

Cancelled my order for a new Model 3 SR+ and for a used LR AWD,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i0mcdn/cancelled_my_order_for_a_new_model_3_sr_and_for_a/,"A new LR AWD was just out of my budget for a car even though I thought it met my needs a little more. Started looking online at used prices and saw several 2020 LR AWDs with less than 7K miles on them and they seemed to bridge the gap perfect for my budget at least.

Got the exact color and wheel choice I wanted and got close to a $3500 discount from what the new price would be for a car that is basically new (only 6 months old). I was told I would have the car in 2-3 weeks and am already much farther in the paperwork on this car in 2 days than I was after a month of waiting for my new SR+

I will post an update with how everything goes and let you know if it was a mistake or not, but if you're torn between LR AWD and SR+ I strongly suggest looking at the 2020 used LR AWD models.",73,2020-07-31 01:48:17,135

Why in 2020 do New Zealand and Australia have to order accessories like its the 80s/90s?,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i0aa43/why_in_2020_do_new_zealand_and_australia_have_to/,"I apologize, this is a bit of a rant but it's a bit frustrating that New Zealand and Australia (and probably other markets outside of North America/Europe) have no means to order accessories from an online store. From Tesla. The company making cars of the future.

Instead, [we're given a PDF](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/en_NZ/M3_Accessories_Digital_Brochure_NZ.pdf) that we can pick what we want out of. For the true 80s/90s feel you can print it out and circle with a marker what you want. You then have to call up the Service Center and communicate to them what you want to buy. To pay, you have to then give them your credit card number over the phone (including expiry and CVV). At that point, the person hangs up and at some point in the future your accessory arrives (I think they wait for a certain number of orders before doing a bulk order from the States).

If you think going to the SC makes the process easier, you'd be wrong. Instead of talking on the phone, you talk to the person directly who takes your credit card and manually enters it into their PC. They have no POS system to handle such orders.

Surely it can't be that difficult to set up some kind of web store for us. Shit, all the Tesla related videos I watch on YouTube have sponsor ads for Squarespace and go on about how easy it is to do. There is also the aspect of hoping they're looking after my credit card details properly.",47,2020-07-30 10:33:03,147

Finally getting MCU2 and FSD installed today,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i0815i/finally_getting_mcu2_and_fsd_installed_today/,"This is a continuation of this thread:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/h89nmb/received\_notification\_in\_tesla\_app\_for\_fsd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/h89nmb/received_notification_in_tesla_app_for_fsd/)

...but my car is currently at the service center getting its upgrade. It certainly took long enough, as here's the timeline and the communication I did (and didn't) receive from Tesla:

May 2020: Had the car in for an unrelated issue. I wrote in ""MCU PLEEZ"" as an additional item to be addressed, but they informed me it wasn't yet released for my VIN. They told me I would see the MCU Upgrade in the ""Upgrades"" section of the app, even though obviously it's not a software upgrade.

6/12/2020: Got a notification in the notifications section of the app that my car was now eligible for FSD. No mention of MCU. I scheduled an appointment that night for 6/24/2020 for MCU, FSD, and some AC issue.

6/17/2020: Service center texted to tell me I'm eligible for MCU but they are backordered on the part. No ETA, so I could either keep my appointment for the AC or cancel and do it all at once later. I asked about the FSD and they said it was the same boat as the MCU. They told me they'd order the part and I would be contacted by the parts department when it was in. I cancelled and waited for contact.

7/6/2020: Three weeks later I get an automated email saying that the part was ordered (apparently just now):

MCU INTEL HW3 UPGRADE-For TegraAP2.0 - WITHOUT DISPLAY - NORTH AMERICAPart #: 9874562-00-BOrder Date: July 6, 2020

The email says I will get two emails per week regarding status until this is resolved. A minute later I receive an almost identical ""update"" email that says the part is ""outstanding"". Since this is the first communication I have received, I assume this meant stuff was moving. The service center nearby books at least two weeks out so I booked an appointment. I set the appointment for the 23rd, but then moved it to the 28th for a personal commitment.

7/23/2020: Never got any more emails in spite of the ""2 per week until done"" promise. Called the service center to confirm they actually had the parts for MCU and FSD. The guy said they got the MCU in a couple days earlier, but I asked about the FSD since it's technically a separate upgrade. He took my info and texted me later to confirm I would get the FSD at the same time (which I took to mean they had them in stock).

7/28/2020: Dropped off my car for service in the morning. Got a text early evening saying it wouldn't be today (didn't honestly expect it back today) but that they'd update me tomorrow.

So it took a while, and they weren't as communicative as they said they'd be, but at least it's finally happening.

7/29/2020: It's 2:25PM today and I'm still waiting to hear back. They texted around 6:30PM and said probably tomorrow.

7/30/2020: They texted around 2:30PM to say they are working on the AC. Apparently the FSD/MCU stuff is done but the AC issue I mentioned is the time consuming part. They texted again later to confirm it was done and I picked it up around 6:30PM. 

I spent 15 minutes sanitizing every interior surface with rubbing alcohol. I verified the new games and features. The new MCU is amazing, but the cameras had to calibrate before I could use AP again and some of the new features require additional time and calibration. I live 12 miles from the new service center, and I had drive about 10 of them before AP started working again, but features like the traffic lights/stop signs need to download maps on wifi and Nav on Autopilot without confirmation still needs calibration time.

Generation 3 Wall Connector power sharing,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i0a68w/generation_3_wall_connector_power_sharing/,"  
The Generation 3 Wall Connector manual indicates the following:   


>""Power Sharing Overview  
**This feature will be available in a future over-the-air firmware update.**  
  
>  
>The firmware-based power sharing feature enables up to 16 Wall Connectors installed at the same site to intelligently share the site's total available power via unit-to-unit Wi-Fi. This minimizes the need for many residential and commercial applications to have specific electrical upgrades for concurrent multi-vehicle charging.""  
​

Has there been any indication of when this update will be made available? I just had 2 of these installed and need to balance power sharing over what's an otherwise over-provisioned circuit. Unfortunately, the generation 2 HPWC are no longer available and they'd used a physical connection between them.... with generation 3 wifi is employed (but evidently not yet enabled).

Absent this feature, what'd be the recommended approach for keeping everything under the max 40A the circuit they're sharing is capable of?",7,2020-07-30 10:26:45,155

Model Y Perf vs Model 3 AWD w/ Accel Boost,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i034ml/model_y_perf_vs_model_3_awd_w_accel_boost/,"Would it be safe to say these are both very comparable from a stats perspective regarding performance?

Both go anywhere from 3.5-3.8s 0-60 ( w rollout) and both have been documented to do the 1/4 mile in 11.8-12.0. Would that be fair to say?

Main reason for asking - currently a Model 3 AWD owner that is debating if the Accel Boost is “worth it”. I’ll be test driving a MY Perf this weekend which should give me an expectation on the “feel” of the Accel Boost.

Problems with Gen 3 Wall Connector,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i02nxz/problems_with_gen_3_wall_connector/,"I have owned my Gen 3 HPWC since mid-June and loved it until this week, when it started throttling my charge to a max of 24A (a theoretical 0-100 charge would take 13.5 hours) and as low as 6A (0-100 charge would take 62.5 hours). Not what I paid for.

It will start charging at 48A (11 kW) then drop to 24A (6 kW) after 30-50 minutes.  When it does this, the HPWC itself will start flashing three red lights, signaling overheating. It does not notify me of “charging interrupted” via the app. Instead, it continues to charge the rest of the way at 24A, simultaneously displaying the red flashing light with the usual green “electricity is flowing” lights.

If you stop the charging after it has throttled to 24A, then restart, it will impose a ceiling of 6A (1 kW)! If you reset the HPWC either via the button on the plug (unplug it and hold the button down 5 seconds) or by turning the breaker off and on, it happily charge at 48A again. I presume it will throttled down to 24A again if you let it go for a while but I’ve never had to charge long enough to know.

If you do nothing and finish the charge at 24A, the app will never notify you that anything went wrong. It will finish the charge and the next time will be at 48A again.

If you go into the car while charging is throttled, you’ll find that the car will not let you set amperage higher than whatever limit the HPWC has set (24A or 6A).

*So my HPWC is overheating then, right? Because that is what those lights mean.* No, the unit is not actually overheating. Nothing is hot. The faceplate is not hot, the cable is not hot, the plug is not hot, the breaker is not hot. And it worked fine for a month under exactly the same conditions.

*An amateurish installation, then? Wrong gauge of wire? Bad breaker?* No, mine is on a dedicated 240V/60A circuit installed by a Tesla recommended electrician who is the dominant installer in my area, has done thousands of these both residential and commercial, gets all 5 star reviews online, and did an amazing job that I watched. And of course it worked fine for a month. It is not the installation.

How can I be so sure it isn’t me? Because I am not the only one where this error has suddenly appeared within the past week or two. **Please see the threads [here](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-wall-charger-gen3-overheating-fix.197220/) and [here](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/gen-3-wall-connector-3-red-blinks-fault-code.198052/) on the teslamotorsclub.com forums (probably best to start with the last page to see the latest udpates).** Several of us have had this suddenly appear every single charge following weeks or months of perfectly normal operation.

I know people hate links to other forums but I assure you I have zero connection with TMC, I only created a login there because I Googled this issue and found those threads. Those threads go into some depth and you can see how it’s not just me! Also, those threads have a 510 area code phone number to call Tesla and actually talk to a person about it. I have done that and the people I’ve talked to have been great. They seem smart and definitely aware that this is an issue. But so far there does not seem to be a solution or even an understanding of exactly what is wrong (bad temp sensors? bad firmware?).

**My request: help us fix this!**

How common is this issue? Do you use a Gen 3 Wall Connector on a 60A circuit? Is this happening to you? Now be aware that you may not even know it’s happening if you regularly charge overnight, because you aren’t watching what is happening. Next time you charge for a few hours, please open the Tesla app on your phone and watch the charge process to see if it drops to 24A. For me and others, it does that after just under an hour of charging.

If and when your charger drops to 24A, please go look at the charger itself and see if it is blinking red. Then please call Tesla so they are aware. Be prepared with your part number and firmware version, both of which are visible when you log into the charger (hold the button to broadcast the SSID then join it and go to 192.168.92.1). I believe the latest firmware is 0.8.58, which is what I have and maybe that is the problem.

Thanks for helping solve this frustrating issue!",16,2020-07-30 03:30:59,160

**ORIGINAL POST (7/28/2020):**

Tesla has officially chosen Austin, Texas, as the location for their next Gigafactory, and it's going to be their biggest factory yet! Construction is already underway, and they plan to complete a Model Y assembly line there by the end of the year. The factory will produce Tesla Semi, Cybertruck, Model 3, and Model Y.

I created an updated high res [scale comparison](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50165165031_c94b721ff6_k.jpg) based on Tesla's [Giga Texas plans](https://electrek.co/2020/07/24/tesla-gigafactory-austin-ecological-paradise-open-public/) and updated [Giga Berlin plans](https://electrek.co/2020/07/02/tesla-changes-gigafactory-berlin-plans-removes-battery-production-test-track/).

Tesla Model 3 Rear Bumper Repair Estimates,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzp7gb/tesla_model_3_rear_bumper_repair_estimates/,"Okay, so quick backstory: I was at work at and had a coworker come in mid shift to tell me someone hit my car and I now had a hole in the bumper. Coming out I see the person with a nice Ford F350 pickup who rear ended my Model 3 and caused the hole in the bumper (he went far over his parking spot and hit mine). Long story short he had no insurance and I ended up filing a police report on it because I was afraid he would flake if I did not as repairs can be costly (even though the actual hit is minimal, there is a hole the size of a golf ball right in the middle of my bumper).

I've taken my car to two different repair shops to see if the estimates on it, and I just wanted to post on here and see if anyone could give me a bit of guidance on the terminology they use as well as what they are saying they need to do. The second repair shop has none of these items on it and they charge far cheaper for their services, both of them are Tesla Certified and after calling Tesla near my area both shops were recommended to be of good quality service for their cars. The second shop had a few other Tesla's on the lot, and the first shop had none.

Repair shop 1:

1. R&I Upper Cover (Note: Allow time to R&I to disconnect 12V Battery). Price: 0.2 Paint labor
2. Repl Prep unprimed bumper Price: 0.7 Paint labor
3. R&I RT Reflector Price: 0.1 Labor
4. R&I LT Reflector Price: 0.1 Labor
5. Subl Calibrate/reset backup sensors Price: $227.50
   1. Set up tool box to communicate with Telsa
6. Maintain Charge on vehicle Price: 0.5 M

If anyone can answer, my question is what these terms mean, if they are needed, and why? (I know what R&I, Repl, and Subl mean btw).

Thank you all for help and let me know if I was unclear on anything or if you need more information! I did not want to post the shop names because I did not want to make it seem as though I was attacking any shop or anything, just generally curious about the things they are charging for.

$5k MCU2 / HW3 Upgrade (MX) (Help!),https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzm1tw/5k_mcu2_hw3_upgrade_mx_help/,"https://imgur.com/gallery/ko0E4z1


Hey everyone so I'm not sure if you guys remember but about a month ago i made a post in regards to Tesla charging me a $2700 fee (On top of the $2500$) for my MCU2 Upgrade...SO I THOUGHT. I made an appointment June 27th and My service was scheduled for July 16th. They called me on the 15th saying they didn't have the parts for the HW3 Upgrade, so they pushed my appointment to July 29th(Tomorrow). I didn't think much of it at the time of scheduling (June 27th) because maybe it was a mistake on their end. Fast forward to today, i called the SC to make sure they had my parts and they said they did! I then proceeded to ask about the extra $2700 charge they put on my invoice (which i thought was MCU 2 Related), but come to find out, its a charge for the HW3 Upgrade!! I have full self driving and if I'm not mistaken HW3 Upgrade should be complimentary. On my invoice it says the Retrofit is free but i still have to pay for the parts? I've never seen this happen to anyone on this Sub or on TMC.com. I didn't really argue with the guy on the phone cause there was no point but I'm definitelyely going to see whats up tomorrow in person, cause this is very confusing. If anyone has any background experience with this or tips on what i should do, please lmk. Thanks!",21,2020-07-29 08:13:33,177
DIY Ultimate Build Model 3 Mattress with all rear gaps filled,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzh3qh/diy_ultimate_build_model_3_mattress_with_all_rear/,"I have reviewed many many options for building or buying a potential perfect mattress setup. It appears all fall short in either the gap between the front seats and rear headrest and/or they don't fill the side gaps far enough.  I plan to make a build that preferably allows for the removal of the back seat.

Plan: Build the widest and fullest possible mattresses and support system for the Model 3.

Testing:

Front Seat and Rear Side Seat Gap: I am looking to test this Pet Barrier (linked below). What's nice is that it has a fold-able plastic core board, and has an extension that goes well into the middle of your body so your body weight acts as a counter weight to the head rest area. Additionally the width of the shelving is 52.75"" extending beyond the seat width and covers nearly all of the side gap. I may be able to even cinch down the lower half to somewhere in the battery well.

[https://www.chewy.com/furhaven-deluxe-pet-barrier-seat/dp/225399](https://www.chewy.com/furhaven-deluxe-pet-barrier-seat/dp/225399)

Mattress: TBD - Will buy a full and then use a electric turkey carver to cut down the foam to spec.

Update 8/1/2020

Furhaven in Model 3: Take a look at the pic. The Furhaven fits like a glove in the Model 3. Waiting for my memory foam topper to custom cut it to fit all the edges. Bed looks like it will be 55x78. The biggest I’ve seen thus far.

"Fixing Smart Summon ""On Public Roads""",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzmfua/fixing_smart_summon_on_public_roads/,"Some of you are plagued with the issue of smart summon not working on private parking lots due to the ""Smart Summon not available on public roads"" message. In hopes of eliminating sources or third-parties of data that contribute to Smart Summon, I have done the following, with no success so far:  

1. Update Open Street Maps (OSM) labelling - also verified by an OSM map editor/fellow Tesla driver.
2. Contacted Mapbox (my understanding is Tesla sources their data) - notified Mapbox of the issue I am facing at my GPS coordinates. Mapbox confirmed it is correctly labelled on their end.

At this time, I can only conclude that the adaption of updated labelling is exceptionally long, or Tesla is sourcing map data or labels from different sources. If anyone knows of other data sources, I would love to know and reach out to the third parties in the attempt to correct the issue. It seems like the most helpful/practical approach would be to contact Tesla; however, this is not realistic, given how busy their teams are.

  
Aside from this, there is the possibility that Tesla knows there are too many places to label correctly and that the anticipated software rewrite will fix this (and I'm just wasting my time haha).

Ordering my first car within the next week or two. I have a few questions and any pro-tips for a first time Tesla owner would be much appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzhgzv/ordering_my_first_car_within_the_next_week_or_two/,"Hello everyone! I have been a long time lurker but within the next week or so i'll be placing an order for a model 3. 

  
I am of course very excited, but this whole process of ordering a car is new to me. I'm used to driving down to the lot, haggling, and seeing the car in person before pulling the trigger. With that being said, I have test driven a model 3, learned a lot about the car, and i'm positive that this is the right move for me. I do have a few questions though.  


First off I plan on getting a loan for the car through a 3rd party lender. I have heard from several people that I should select 'loan' when purchasing, then switch to cash to 'get the ball rolling' and then switch back to loan before I pickup the car. Can someone ELI5 what this is about?   


Second- Because of Covid, my loan won't be ready until September 4th. Because of this, I have been very hesitant to order the car because some people say their order is ready within 2 weeks or so. Obviously this would be a huge problem for me because I can't pick up the car until Sept 4th at the earliest. On the flip side, I also don't really want to wait until mid October to end up picking up the car.   
\-- A few people suggested that I wait until early-mid August to place my order and it should be ready by the end of September since the 3rd quarter is ending. - Based on everyone's experience, if you were in my situation, when would you order?  


To kind of piggyback off the statement above, I have a question regarding delivery. From what I understand, you get a text letting you know that your car is ready to pickup, and you schedule pickup date? (please correct me if i'm wrong). Anyway, assuming this is the case, - suppose I get the text today asking me to schedule my pickup. If i'm not ready today, or out of town etc, can I schedule pickup for 2,3,4 weeks out or is there some sort of limit/time frame that I need to pickup the car in?  


Last question (if you have made it this far, thank you for taking the time to help me out). I heard that Tesla will require a loan number or exact amount financed in order to get the VIN or move on with the process. How is this possible without paying on the loan early?? I know that i'll be putting 13k cash down- i'm selling my car probably a day or two before I pickup the model 3 and that cash will also be used as a down payment. I have a rough estimate in mind regarding how much i'll get for my current car, but I don't know exact numbers. I wont know how much I need to ask from the bank until day of/day before. How can I provide Tesla loan number or exact figure without paying on the loan early?  


Once again, thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I know it's an incredibly long post, possibly with a few stupid questions but I just want to make sure everything runs smooth. Aside from the wall of text and multiple questions, if you have any Pro Tips, tricks, etc for a first time EV/Tesla owner, please let me know.

My speculation for battery day,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzg45s/my_speculation_for_battery_day/,"Writing this as a tesla investor.

At battery day in September tesla will announce some kind of breakthrough in battery technology, possibly solid state batteries at an extremely competitive price. If this is the case there will be huge implications on their vehicles, but it is not what I'm most curious about. 

What other implications will that have on the worlds transition to sustainable energy?

We already know that tesla is balancing the grid in Australia with their batteries, and that tesla is about to become an utility company in UK. We also know that elon thinks the energy part is expected to be at least as important for tesla as their vehicles. 

The world is installing more and more renewable energy, from wind and solar. This is great, though it comes with a backside: intermittent production and highly shifting electricity prices (for instance Denmark, with a lot of wind power frequently sees negative electricity prices on windy days in the summertime and huge price spikes on calm, cold winter days)

There is a great need to expand the electricity grid to transfer the intermittent electricity from where it is produced to the consumer.

To mitigate the need for investment in the grid and even out the prices throughout the day and the year, powerpacks along the backbone electricity grid could be used.

My speculation is that Tesla is about to provide the final piece to the puzzle on battery day: cheaper and bigger batteries to balance the grid.

The location of these packs could be anywhere along the grid, where land is cheap. 

The obvious producer of the energy will be tesla customers, from their solar roofs.

The obvious consumer will be tesla owners, at the supercharger stations. (Along with everybody else connected to the grid, I.e the highest bidder)

The economic in this infrastructure comes from the auto bidder software. The arbitrage between low and peak hours, combined with the fixed income from the supercharger stations makes it possible for tesla to guarantee the potential solar roof customers a fixed income, hence boosting the sales of solar installations at all markets where tesla is present. 

I guess this is right in line with Elons mission to boost the transition to sustainable energy. All other technology is in place already, and with huge cheap batteries to balance the grid and auto bidder software the payback time for these investments will be a lot shorter than before. 

Another market for tesla to disrupt. Your thoughts? ",7,2020-07-29 02:56:56,189

Advice on completely unacceptable service,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hz0wrk/advice_on_completely_unacceptable_service/,"So my Model X was overheating and had a piece of the wheel well trim coming loose. I put in for an appointment through the app and had to wait 16 days for the appointment. Meanwhile the car can’t be driven due to lack of AC. Dropped it off last Wednesday. No loaners as usual. Today after 6 days of no updates and as usual not being able to get anyone to pick up the phone, I drove back to Tesla to see what’s up. It is still sitting there untouched and they have no answer as to when it will even be ready. Still no loaner. Uber credits expire today and just shrugs and I’m sorry. Asked for a service manager and was told he was in a meeting. I am sitting in the waiting room waiting. This is the Las Vegas service center.

Model 3 Creaking/Squeaking Front Suspension at 35K Miles,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hyzg5m/model_3_creakingsqueaking_front_suspension_at_35k/,"My Model 3 is a year old and I've got 35K miles on it.

Also, when I get in and out of the car. I can also get out and push down on the hood and replicate the sound so it seems like it's suspension related.   


Has anyone else ran into this problem? Does this require a service center stop or can mobile service team handle this? Just looking for any insight from anyone else who might have encountered the problem.

HW3.0 in a HW2.5 Model S,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hyzxf5/hw30_in_a_hw25_model_s/,"Was able to get my 2017 Model S retrofitted to HW3.0. I’m hoping by now most early adopters have had the retrofit now to help my question. I recently to my S up to Los Angeles and was on AP 90% of the way. From San Diego area, I hit little traffic and car did fairly well with no phantom breaking. However on way back, the car was horrible. 
First the MCU, still have MCU1 with no date when I can upgrade. Getting directions back to SD area from MCU took approximately 5 min to figure out a route. This was with almost full bars of LTE. The MCU needed a reboot twice. Both times , my navigation got lost and couldn’t reroute. 
On autopilot, once on the freeway was heavy traffic. NOA was on and when traffic wa a moving 10-15mph, my brakes would engage in a way you would think I was about to crash. Additionally. Going around 65 mph, and traffic starting to slow, the car couldn’t recognize traffic coming to a stop. The dash didn’t show other lane slowing down and had to disengage AP. 
I am wondering if anyone else who has had retrofit done has had similar issues. If anyone has seen a significant decrease in performance from MCU1 as well. Hope this was specific enough information for everyone.

EDIT: So my local service center replied back to me stating they are aware of the issue and engineers are working on it. Unfortunately, nothing can be done now and I need to wait. In mean time, I have to do scroll wheel resets, disappointing",10,2020-07-28 08:15:28,210

Evolution of displayed range with updates and hardware evolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hyykxw/evolution_of_displayed_range_with_updates_and/,"Lets just clarify the fact that this is not a complaint post, I'm just really data driven and would like to understand everything a little more.

I bought my Model 3 LR AWD last year (May 2019), at that time, the announced range for that trim was 499km (sorry fellow Americans :P ). Now, I know the displayed range is a function of the battery charge and EPA rating with the calculated energy remaining and is affected by battery degradation. Honestly I always use % but I like to check from time to time to see the evolution.

Recently I got a pretty sudden drop in ""full"" range which surprised me because it happened all at once but its not stressing me out. (Went from 498km full to about 478km full, I have 21000km driven)

What is interesting to me is that the displayed range does not seem to be linear with my observations

* 100% -> 478km
* 50% -> 246km (would expect 239km)
* 10% -> 50km (wait what? if you extrapolate my full battery would be 500km?)

When I saw that I started looking into it and saw lots of things about the BMS and calibration so I decided to give it a try (drop battery to \~5% and charge to 100%) but no change at all.

After that another thing that was interesting to me is the change of advertised range on new models. At some point last year Tesla updated the range on LR AWD to 518km. I thought that this was an hardware improvement and did not expect any change on my car. However I was talking with someone with a 2018 LR AWD and this person now has a range of 513km so I was wondering if someone else had this ""bump"" via software and should I have expected it?

I'm very interested to hear about your experiences!",8,2020-07-28 07:05:38,213
"Was on my way to pickup my MY this morning, was told to turn around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hyt65j/was_on_my_way_to_pickup_my_my_this_morning_was/,"About 15 minutes prior to me picking up my W/W MY LR AWD this morning, the dealer called and told me he couldn’t let me take delivery, due to a substantial dent in the rear. It’s on the way to a body shop now. Very disappointing, as both me and my brother took off from work to receive the car.

By way of options, I also asked if I could at least see the car to inspect it for other defects, so they could be addressed at the shop while working on the dent. I was told the car was not at the dealer location and they were unsure which body shop would be working on it. I asked that they let me know asap, so I can head there to take a look. I wasn’t given any assurances, other than that they’ll go over the whole car while there, before delivery is scheduled again.

I’m kind of disappointed, but I thought I’d post here to see what options you all think I have.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the great advice. I’m still not 100% sure what to do, but the insight has helped and I feel a lot more comfortable either way. Looking forward to getting the car eventually!

Update: For anyone following this... Tesla called and said there was NO DENT, and that is must have been a “shadow” the person saw at the dealership. I’m in disbelief, but we’ll see when I pick up the car tomorrow at 4pm. They said the SC inspected the car for any other defects, and it’s “perfect.” I’m a little skeptical, but hoping for the best!

Final Update: Picked up the car! There were very minor panel/paint issues. No dent whatsoever in the back. Overall, I’m extremely happy. I know Tesla has gotten a bit of a bad reputation for CS, but my personal experience was fantastic. The car is absolutely amazing. Thank you all again!",11,2020-07-28 02:22:56,214

"Early 20s, chance of getting a loan for a Model 3?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hzc30x/early_20s_chance_of_getting_a_loan_for_a_model_3/,"Current plan is to get a Model 3 in the second half of next year. I currently drive a 2004 Honda Accord I paid for outright and have been driving for around 4 years, so I haven’t had an auto loan yet, or even a student loan to worry about.

I have about 4 years of pretty positive credit history as well. I’m in my early 20s for reference. Never had a missed payment. Have a few accounts open and a good amount of credit available. Credit score in the lower 700s, but I just cleared up some high utilization, so should be going up to mid, possibly high 700s before purchase. 

As for the car itself, looking to get the base spec’d Model 3 SR+ and plan to put somewhere in the ballpark of 12-16k down, leaving around 25k to be financed.

So my question is, do I have a good chance of getting an auto loan in my situation? My debt-to-income should be good as I have pretty much 0 debt, and at the time of purchase will likely just have a few hundred dollars on a credit card. My salary isn’t the highest, but that’s why I’m looking to offset that with a well sized down payment, as the monthly payments, even with 60 months and a higher APR, become pretty easily manageable in my situation. Any insight would be helpful.

Just ahead of time I’d like to say I’ve already had to conversation of “is this the right financial decision for me”, so not really looking for that sort of input, but more directly on my luck getting a loan. Thanks in advance.",0,2020-07-28 22:11:59,220

In 2017, AP wobble issues were fairly common, but were essentially eliminated with updates in early 2018. 

A little over a year ago it started again and I had Tesla look at it. They confirmed the issue via road test, and confirmed that I had no alignment issue, tires/wheels were great, but said updates had been released that may have bugs and updates were coming that should fix it. And that’s pretty much what happened.... or so I thought. Now I’m wondering if not. 

Took my wife and kids on a ~1500 mile drive to visit family and it was consistently wobbling to the point of being completely unusable which is so frustrating on a long drive like that. Seems to only happen with a few people in the car and only over 60/65 mph. Does pretty well without either of those conditions. 

To clarify when I say wobble, it bounces back and forth within the lane and depending on the road, can get so bad it seems incredibly dangerous. I obviously disengage before that, so I can’t say what would happen if I let it continue.

Anyone have similar issues? Any ideas on what might be causing it or a fix? Or am I just f’ed until I upgrade to FSD and get the 3.0?",22,2020-07-27 10:25:42,224

They texted me in advance and had me come to the service center.  I could either drop it off during business hours and click a link to notify them and have someone come out, or drop it off after hours and put the key in the Dropbox.

24 hours later the work was done and they parked it in the lot with the key dismantled in the frunk and locked it with a PIN code.  I showed up two days later, unlocked the car with my phone, entered the PIN and drove away.  Never a human interaction required other than SMS.

Still needs some map downloads for the stop sign features to show up, but everything else worked immediately, including the new color backing camera view they added.

Another eMMC failure post? No....,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hy1b8o/another_emmc_failure_post_no/,"My (broken) Tesla Model S75, November 2016 facelift with 97k miles, 
The following symptoms have been getting worse for over a year now:

* Weak/no data signal majority of time
* No spotify (constantly spinning arrow) 
* Web Browser doesn’t work
* Voice commands don’t work
* Maps drawing slow
* Screen locking and rebooting
* Slow unresponsive MCU
* Indicator randomly fails, stops working
* Takes over 8 minutes to reboot
* No VIN number in display (VINISEMPTY) (recent)
* Music wont switch off when locking the car despite all displays off (recent)

The dreaded eMMC chip wearing out?
The good people at Tesla told me the wear level was in limit spec last December, and still is today.

Last week, in an attempt to stop the clunkiness of the MCU I started manually deleting navigation history and as this was taking so long I did a factory reset but apparently that’s the worst thing that I could have done.

My car is well out of warranty but I took it to Tesla thinking it was the eMMC. However the diagnosis was corrupt software on the main partition. It was stuck in a download state (not visible to me) and the 64gb main OS partition should only have around 9gb for the update files but it was full and corrupt.
The car didn’t know what was going on and thought it’s birthday was in 1970!

The fix? The partitions were wiped by Tesla and reinstalled along with certs etc.
The result?
Wow, I have my snappy MCU1 back and is like it was when I bought it.
I can web browse, Spotify works quickly, tune in works great, maps are quick again and where it used to take 8 min to reboot, it now takes 52 seconds to the Tesla T with a further 30 seconds to ‘full on’ state.
It also now takes seconds to come on when I get in the car to drive away.

Im sure many may have failing eMMC but despite my Model S being 3.5 years old and nearly at 100k miles, it was not the chip.",4,2020-07-26 17:20:28,239

UPDATE - Model Y let me down on the hottest day of the year...,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hxe0hf/update_model_y_let_me_down_on_the_hottest_day_of/,"So, about 10 days ago, I posted about my [Model Y having a pretty major issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hrb0zs/model_y_let_me_down_on_the_hottest_day_of_the_year/) and having to be towed to the Service Center.  A lot of people messaged me (publicly and privately) and here's the update & resolution.  Im writing this from memory over the last week, so forgive me if 

On July 14th, the car had - in Elon/SpaceX speak - an anomaly.  You can read about the issue in the link above.  After some discussion with Roadside Assistance, they made sure that I was someplace safe and first thing in the morning (at my request), they dispatched a flatbed to bring my car on a 3-hour ride to the closest Service Center.  

On July 15th, the flatbed arrived.  The car was dead and dark - the app would not connect, the key card would not work.  The doors were locked...wasnt looking very promising.  After going over the issue with the driver, he popped off the tow cover on the front bumper, connected a jump box to a couple wires (which popped the frunk), and then connected the jump box to the 12v battery which began to bring some life back to the car.  The doors unlocked and the screen turned on - but the car did not have enough power to enter tow mode - so a few slides had to be used to get her up on the wrecker.  

Later that afternoon, the Service Center called to let me know they received the car and would start diagnostics in the morning.  

July 16th, the Service Center reached out again to update that they had started the diagnostic process and would be reaching out with an update on the 17th.

July 17th, the update was pretty interesting.  Diagnostics uncovered that the wiring harness connecting the Heat Pump and the 12v had shorted and also damaged part of the 12v battery housing.  Both items needed to be ordered and replaced.  Additionally, as part of the process, the trim around the driver's window was damaged and would be replaced as well.  The order would be made, and the parts would take 3-5 days to get shipped and then installed.    

Fast forward and the service was completed a day *early*.  I drove out and picked up the car and drove home with no real issues.  Ill be happy to answer any questions anyone has about my experience.  

tl;dr - after hearing some horror stories, I was very pleased with how communicative the Service Center was through the process.  The car was repaired and picked up ahead of schedule.  Happy with the resolution!",342,2020-07-25 13:14:20,247
My experience contradicts most posts - Nema installation cost and 110 110v charge time,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hydnps/my_experience_contradicts_most_posts_nema/,"For anyone searching this later

I often read that a NEMA installation would cost sub 1000. From a fairly reliable electrician I was estimated 2000 for the work and 600 for the permits. East bay area town. That is far more than I was expecting.

&#x200B;

I also often read that it would take 4 days to charge my Model 3 on 110v. I have it set to go from 20% to 80% and the onboard computer just quoted me 25 hours. Which is a lot, but doable.

Excruciating high-pitched whine,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hxqpj5/excruciating_highpitched_whine/,"I took delivery of a Model Y 2 days ago (an early July build w/ VIN #22XXX) and am encountering a problem w/ a very high-pitched whine (the best analogue that comes to mind is it sounds like a dental implement) from what I believe to be the rear motor. It typically consists of a high-pitched whine that correlates with pedal input above a certain speed, persists at certain speeds, pulsing / beeping of sorts, et cetera. We didn’t hear this in either of the demo Model Ys we test drove. And this is definitely not something I've experienced in my Model 3 dual motor AWD. It's so egregious that despite how much I love my Model 3 and generally advocate Tesla to others I wouldn't have opted into this vehicle for my wife at all. Had a test drive been part of delivery acceptance it also wouldn't have been accepted.

The earliest available service appointment I could get scheduled is the 31st. That concerns me given it's outside the 7 day return window and I really have no appetite for a protracted battle w/ Tesla over whether this is ""within spec"" or not. I also really have no desire to desire to return it and be returned to the queue since the vehicle is otherwise in a good enough state (it has a few trim & seat alignment issues that I expect ought be routine to adjust).

Has anyone here encountered, or better yet, achieved resolution on this?

Need some targeted advice about buying an older Model S,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hxdnq7/need_some_targeted_advice_about_buying_an_older/,"Hi all, My first reddit post. I have been thinking for a long time about buying my first Tesla. I worry. I have browsed the prior threads on buying a used Model S, but I think my needs for a car are different than those expressed by those posters. Hoping to get more targeted advice.

My situation: I do not want a Model 3 since I would hope to fit my family in the car for long trips. I also do not care much about some of the advanced technology--except for the aspects that will improve the basic functions of a car, i.e. faster charging, more capacity etc. I don't care about auto pilot or any related self driving technology. I am the type of person that uses maybe 4 functions on my iPhone. Basically, I'd like a reliable used electric car for around the $30-35K mark that I can keep for 5-8 years. Looks like I might be able to get something like a 5 year-old Model S with 50-80K miles for that. So my questions: Is there a minimum model year where the technology is a must have for basic performance issues, i.e. charging, reliability, etc.? Or is there not much difference (again, basic performance wise) between a 2013 with 50k mileage and a 2018 with the same mileage? Regarding EVs generally, is mileage as much of an issue, or is the age of the battery a big/bigger concern? Is there anything I should be aware of when looking at Model S with this age/mileage? Any advice much appreciated!

Actually, one more question, is there any big upside to buying used from Tesla? I hate car dealerships and was intending to buy from a third party. thanks!",15,2020-07-25 12:51:00,264

HomeLink no longer working after HW3 upgrade. Solution in post.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hx5941/homelink_no_longer_working_after_hw3_upgrade/,"Recently got my HW3 upgrade after waiting over a year (it’s awesome)! The install took a little over 3 hours but it worked perfectly except my garage opener via Tesla HomeLink and front power windows no longer worked. I resolved the front power windows by reading the Tesla forums, basically had to reprogram the windows with the window button. (Do a full cycle of windows by lighting pressing the window button and right before the window closes do a hard pull like you would do when you want to power close the window, then power windows should work again)

For the HomeLink issue I chatted with a Tesla Representative on the website and waited 30 minutes plus for a representative which was ko help because they just offered the simple troubleshooting options such as reprogram HomeLink, delete profile and program again which I had already tried.

Then I created a Mobile Service request and Tesla contacted me next day via SMS saying that they needed to push a firmware update to my car specifically for HomeLink because they forgot to do that when HW 3 was installed. I installed the firmware update and then reprogrammed my garage door opener to HomeLink and works perfect again.

I couldn’t find this information anywhere online so I hope it helps someone in the future.

Note: I have a Model 3",51,2020-07-25 04:46:31,266

My insurance premium for a 2020 Performance Model Y is less than 2018 LR RWD Model 3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hwsol1/my_insurance_premium_for_a_2020_performance_model/,"Just a weird occurrence I thought I would document for you.

Thought this was quite interesting.

Even more fascinating is that the new Model Y is a Performance model, whereas the Model 3 was just a LR RWD.

Anyway, my situation is special; I'm 22 on a Progressive plan with 5 other older cars/drivers, and my premiums for Model 3 for 6 months was $420. (not joking.) With Model Y, I'm paying $393 / 6mos.

The Progressive person explained that because the Model 3 was an older vehicle, that might have something to do with the fact that Model Y was cheaper to insure. Maybe XUV's are cheaper to insure than Sedans, or something.",49,2020-07-24 13:35:37,284

Extension cable for mobile charger,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hwkx8b/extension_cable_for_mobile_charger/,"Hi all,

I am looking to get a Model 3 soon. My plan involves renting a detached garage, which has an available outlet on the ceiling. Given my commute, I figured I would charge using the provided Mobile Charger and a typical NEMA 5-15 adapter; I don’t need faster charging. However, the location of the outlet has me worried.

I have read the user manual and noticed that extension cables should not be used to charge a Model 3.

Does anyone have thoughts or advice? I don’t want to go against the user manual, but it sounds safe as long as you’re smart about it.

TL;DR: Outlet on ceiling. Want to use mobile connector to charge with 15 amps. Wondering if a proper extension cable is safe.",15,2020-07-24 06:20:41,303

I'd be open to it if they see it fit, but as of this moment I do not see it working out. I somehow feel it will be very difficult to navigate unless FSD is enabled. If FSD is not enabled, I feel this touchless touch screen would just raise chances of accidents occurring due to the fact that many drivers would be focused on making sure their finger is floating above the correct option on the screen. I don't care how much they claim that it helped drivers keep their eyes on the road. I think it'd do the complete opposite.",0,2020-07-25 07:07:17,305

A transcription of everything Elon had to say about the FSD rewrite during the Q2 investor call,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hw7csk/a_transcription_of_everything_elon_had_to_say/,"This is what Elon had to say regarding the impact the FSD rewrite will have on functionality: 

""*We're currently testing full self-driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally test the latest alpha build of whole self-driving software when it when I drive my car and it is really I think profoundly better than people realize. Yeah, really profoundly better. It's like amazing.*   
*It's almost getting to the point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions. Despite going through construction and widely varying situations. So this is why I am very confident about also driving functionality being complete by the end of this year because I'm literally driving it.*""

Later, this is what Elon had to say about the rewrite itself:

""*Well, The actual major milestone that's happening right now is really transition of the autonomy system in our cars AI,  from thinking about things in terms of two and a half dimensions. Like they think it's best to take like isolated pictures and during image recognition on the pictures that are partially correlated in time, but not very well. Transitioning to 4D where you know, it's like video essentially, you get thinking about the world in three dimensions and in the fourth dimension being time, so that's the architectural change which has been underway for some time, but it's not been rolled out to anyone in the production Fleet. Thus far is really just been with like 2D. Mostly 2D. So just, it's just hard to convey. Just how much better the fully 4D system will work. It does work. It's capable of things that that if you're just looking at things as individual pictures as opposed to video...* 

*So They seem to have just like a giant Improvement. Probably roll it out later this year. But, you know, it'll be able to do traffic lights, stops, turns, everything, you know pretty much and then it will be a long march of nines essentially. So definitely way better than human, but how much better is going to be? That, that's actually going to be the real work. Is just a massive amount of work with each kind of order of magnitude of reliability.*   
*But you'll see it happen. And if you plot the points on the curve, it'll be kind of obvious where it's headed.*""",173,2020-07-23 14:15:46,307
Tesla solar panels on Decra roof? Advice needed!,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hwh6xy/tesla_solar_panels_on_decra_roof_advice_needed/,"Has anyone here had any luck with Tesla installing their solar panels on a stone-coated steel roof? The particular kind of roof I have is a Decra tile roof and I'm having a lot of trouble getting a solid answer from anyone about getting solar installed. The short of the long is that this roof is less than 10 years and is in great condition and I have no desire to change or replace any of it. I have heard via phone calls with Tesla that this roof would immediately disqualify me from getting Tesla solar panels installed. It seems though that this is not always the case as random forums on the internet say that people have gotten Tesla solar installed. I don't know if it's just uninstaller per installer thing but it's extremely frustrating that I want to get Tesla panels on my roof because the price they offer is far and away the best in my area. 

All of the other providers in southern California don't even come close to the price that Tesla offers. I know in most cases that for this style of roof, you have to get a particular item called a j hook, or something similar, if you want to put panels up so that it doesn't sit directly on the stone-coded tiles themselves. Underneath there is a good backing of plywood that runs across the entire roof so I know that there is good material to mount to. There are a number of solar providers in my area that said they will install on my roof, but as I stated before, all of them are tens of thousands of dollars more than Tesla.

Has anyone had any experience with getting Tesla solar installed on this kind of roof? I am trying to get a site survey through Tesla so that I can speak to somebody in person at my house about this but I don't know if there is anything else I should do.

Update: I contacted Tesla and was on the phone for nearly an hour. I explain my situation to the rep and asked for any way that I could get the system installed on my roof. I asked if they would work with any of the local installers in my area, I asked if they knew anything about the j hooks, I asked if there was any way at all that I could make this happen. The short answer was no. The rent did tell me exactly what one of the other users commented and that was that they use a very special mounting system. He said Tesla would only go so far as to installing power walls if I want to get solar from some other company. The company's my area is still cannot compete price wise though. The most erected tell me is that the prices are changing all the time and the reps only know about it about 24 hours prior. You recommend that I at least get an up-to-date quote for the solar roof and just refer myself to get an extra $400 of credit. I just have a hard time justifying approximately $20,000 difference between the solar panel install and the solar roof install when my roof is in perfect condition currently.",16,2020-07-24 03:03:26,308

Montreal -> Toronto Delivery Questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hwjgff/montreal_toronto_delivery_questions/,"Hi gang,  


A few weeks ago I paid the deposit for a new M3.  The salesman I worked with on the phone told me that although there were no M3s near me in Toronto, there were some located in Montreal and that they would be able to transport one to Toronto for me.  A few days later I had my VIN and a delivery date set for a few days later.

  
Fast-forward a few weeks and the car is still sitting in Montreal.  I have received multiple different delivery dates, all of which have been cancelled and pushed back.  The original explanation I received was that the contractors that they use for car transportation were very backlogged because of Covid.  Today I found out that is not the case, and that the Logistics Department is actually just waiting for a full truckload before any will be shipped out.  


This is frustrating because now my delivery date hinges on enough other people from Toronto buying cars that are also located in Montreal with mine.  What makes it worse is that there are no other M3s listed in Montreal, which will make it even harder to fill that truck.  


Has anyone been in this situation before?  Will the Tesla folks eventually concede and send a partially empty truck?  Or just get someone to drive my car if it is the only one?  


I have even thought about going to pick it up myself, but I am not sure if that is allowed.",5,2020-07-24 05:04:50,314

"The Tesla app said I would be able to work with the service rep to get a loaner vehicle when I arrived, but when I arrived they said I should have called ahead to receive a loaner and then proceeded to make me pay to rent a car from Enterprise, not fix the issue, and this was all for a warranty fix.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hw319k/the_tesla_app_said_i_would_be_able_to_work_with/,"Hey guys. I’m just wondering if this is standard practice. 

When I made the service appointment for a broken temp sensor on my Model 3 Performance, I read that I could work with the service representative when I arrive to receive a loaner vehicle. 

When I arrived at the service center I mentioned that I would need a loaner and in the past this was totally fine and they would get a car for me. This time, however, the service rep said that I should have called ahead and told them, because they don’t have any cars available. I had a work meeting to go to within the hour. I told him that and he said that he could call Enterprise, but that I would have to pay. 

I received a vehicle from Enterprise and then made it a little late to my meeting. 

They said my car would be done by 4 and that they had to order parts.

So, I paid $50 for a rental for them to tell me 5 hours later that they have to order the sensor and I need to come get the car. 

When I came to pick up the car there was another service rep there and he was very confused as to why I had paid for the rental, seeing that it was a warranty so he asked the other guy and in front of me said, “She didn’t call ahead, so she doesn’t get it paid for.” 

I promise you guys I was super nice and even told them I’m not bitching but was just confused by the what the app said and everything. 

Has anyone else had this happen? Is it standard practice or should I mention it to someone at the dealership?

Update!! Hey guys. Thanks to the awesome Reddit community and to the awesome people at Tesla Cleveland. They called and said that what happened shouldn’t have happened and they made sure we were taken care of. Like I said, we usually have an awesome experience with them, so I know that it was probably just a bad day for one guy and not a reflection of the whole place. ❤️",105,2020-07-23 09:54:23,319

Wishlist of Release Notes for a Software Update,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hwcjua/wishlist_of_release_notes_for_a_software_update/,"What follows are fictional release notes for a software update based on my experience driving a Model 3 for over a year living in Germany. I love this car most of the time. But there are certain things I really wish they would change/add.

What do you think about my suggestions? What would you wish for? What is the best way to make Tesla aware of bugs/suggestions?

**Internet Access**

* Changed the mobile provider to connect to the internet while driving in Germany. This change allows to make use of services like Spotify and surfing the web throughout the day, which was previously not possible in parts of Germany.
* Downloading software updates is now possible without a wireless connection when a Premium Connectivity subscription is active.

**Multimedia**

* USB devices formatted as exFAT are now supported for music playback.
* Playlist files are now supported (.pls, .m3u, ...).
* Changed the behavior after the last song of a folder was played. Instead of doing nothing the fist song of the next folder in the the same hierarchy is played. After the last folder it looks one folder up in the hierarchy until a song was found.
* When changing the music source the last played song will now be remembered and continues immediately after switching back to the original source.
* Fixed a bug that causes music from USB not continuing when entering the car, after is was in sleep mode for an extended amount of time.

**Autopilot**

* There is now an option to disable Traffic-Aware Cruse Control. While Traffic-Aware Cruse Control is disabled the Autopilot only tries to maintain the Cruising Speed while keeping the set distance to the car in front, ignoring oncoming traffic and lane markings.
* Engaging the Autopilot now always sets the current speed as Cruising Speed.
* An option was added to allow the use of the cabin camera to verify that the drivers hands are on the steering wheel, making slight steering unnecessary.

**Climate Control**

* In addition to A/C, heating can now manually be disabled.
* Disabling A/C or heating does not deactivate the Auto setting.

**Additional Notes**

* Fixed a bug that causes the right side mirror not folding out completely under specific conditions.",10,2020-07-23 21:15:35,322

Edit: just saw the “CyberHatch” design that got published on InsideEVs. Not that one. That one looks terrible.",0,2020-07-24 02:00:29,333
Advice: 2016 Model S - Out of Warranty Repair Cost,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hwl95u/advice_2016_model_s_out_of_warranty_repair_cost/,"Currently my 2016 Model S is out of warranty by 9000 miles. I noticed a very loud clanging coming from my front driver side wheel at low speeds (1-15 MPH). When I go over a speed bump, it would sound like metal clanging coming from the drive side front wheel. Eventually I heard a loud noise sounding while backing up, sounded like when you hit a huge pot hole on the freeway.

Took it to Telsa and they said they would need to replace all the parts in the image. Now I never hit any big pot holes or curbs recently for this to happen. Seems like these parts are detective. I spoke with the service rep and he said they would need to replace these parts because there is an ""updated"" version.

Any advice on how to deal with this... hoping I don't need to spend $1400 to fix what seems to be a original defect.

Service Bulletin:  https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2017/MC-10110741-9999.pdf

UPDATE:

I talked to the service guy and was able to get a $200 discount with the final bill of $1200. Had really no choice to pay it since the car was undrivable at low speeds. They were able to fix it within a day because they had all the parts in stock. 

When I went to pick up the car and briefly talked to the service guy. I asked him ""Hey is there something I can do to mitigate this issue from happening again?"" He basically said ""I don't know, it has nothing to do with style of driving and there was no collision in that area."" Then I basically said, ""So I just got a bad part and it was bad timing that it broke out of warranty."" He said ""Yea.""

All in all happy that my car is back but for people who have my year and running out of warranty, take it to service and ask them to do a suspension check and reference the service bulletin above. Also tell them to check those parts in the picture of my estimate.",0,2020-07-24 06:37:22,334

Got a Job offer to Work at Tesla. I'm Torn whether to commit fully.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hvqc1o/got_a_job_offer_to_work_at_tesla_im_torn_whether/,"Hello. I'm fairly young, in my mid 20's. I live in Michigan. I recently applied for Tesla a couple months back at the Fremont, CA location just to see what happens and I've gotten a email, For a zoom interview for Tesla a week ago. I thought it was going to be a Individual zoom meeting, but it ended up being a group of 20+ people for the sells pitch for the job, and the recruiter answered our questions. It was kinda of red flag to me. They gave the people at the zoom meeting all a job offer pending pre-employment background and drug test.  I already done my Drug test so I've kinda soft committed, but I still want to keep my options open.

One thing I should mention. Where I currently stay, I've just gotten a job to the Big 3 in Michigan. I work for Ford, but I've only been there for 3 weeks as of today. Ford is considered one of the best jobs to have here in my area. Ford has a Union and the UAW here is very strong.  I have a good resume background for Auto manufacturing. By no means I'm a engineer. I'm basically a production associate.

The thing is that I've always been a passionate about Tesla. I know for a fact I will give my all to Tesla if I work there. The problem is. I will have to relocate there, which is I don't mind, if I didn't already have a Job and nothing to lose. But me being in Ford makes it complicated. I know in at least 3 years I can make close to over 70K a year at Ford with more upside the more time I get there. They offer in house skill trades and a lot of others opportunities and benefits.

Tesla's production starting pay is at 19 a hour, which is more than what I make a Ford right now, but the cost of living in California evens it out. They offer 6000 dollars towards they stock and Health and Dental day 1. Tesla's is non union which is good and bad. Only thing that's in the air for me is the long term opportunities there, do they offer programs like Ford where you can train in house for skill trades or other schooling?

This is one of the most toughest decisions in my life.  I have nothing in Michigan holding me back, like Kids or a girlfriend. Money is not a problem for me to move there. The only thing whether it's the right decision for me long term. I'm on 90 day probation at Ford, so I'm not permanent yet. So it's not like i'm leaving the company with years under my belt. I just need non toxic opinions, preferably from people that worked at the Fremont plant, but all opinions is appreciated. :)",51,2020-07-22 20:54:38,340

Mine do not seem to be actually spraying anything. At least from the driver side wiper. It was more noticeable a while back, now it seems to do little to nothing when spraying fluid.

I just cleaned out the nozzles with a pin and didn’t notice any difference. I can hear the pump running and even disconnected the fluid hoses and it for sure has enough power. Just doesn’t seem to make it out the jets like it used to.

Thanks!

I had removed all the old washer fluid from the tank, and replaced with 1/2 distilled vinegar and water.  Ran the wipers for about 5 minutes continuously.  Blockages cleared and washer jets are working as normal now.

I am in a bit of a pickle with paying for supercharging.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hvmy9s/i_am_in_a_bit_of_a_pickle_with_paying_for/,"I bought a model 3 about 3 weeks ago from a private seller, still waiting for the bank/dmv to release the title, but it's taking forever, plus it has to be mailed to me by the seller.  Seller went ahead and deleted the car from his account when I got there to pick up the car, so  ""transferring"" the vehicle ownership to me wasn't an option (or at least it didn't occur to me till now)   When I tried to register the car to my tesla account, of couse, it had to ask for a title or registration that matches my license name and I do not have that because title isn't here yet.

I've been charging from various destinations chargers when i can, but supercharger is where I get most of the juice.  Without tesla account, I was still able to charge at supercharger as long as I put in credit card information after the screen alerts me that I owe money for the charge and I have to update the credit card info each time I supercharge.  (strangely, my info isn't getting saved, so I am having to put it in every time).

&#x200B;

After the latest software update, now when I click  ""update payment information"" to put in the card, it won't even let me click it to go into the payment screen.  So I am now officially prohibited from using supercharger because I owe them $7.20 for last charge!

&#x200B;

If I had a house, all this wouldn't have been less annoying because I would be able to trickle charge at least, but I am an apt dweller until december, so this is more annoying than it would be for most tesla owners out there.  Plus, using the keycard is getting old really fast to get in and out.  Most annoying is when I want to open the passenger door to get something out, I have to go around, tap the keycard, and come back to the passenger side to get stuff.  When I am done....you guessed right, I have to go back to the driver side to tap the card again.

Are there benefits of having a Tesla wall charger for a Model 3 other another brand?,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hvtl9l/are_there_benefits_of_having_a_tesla_wall_charger/,"Hi all, 

Firstly, apologies if this question has been asked before - I'd really appreciate if someone can point in the right direction if so as I wasn't able to find a clear answer when googling. 

I am getting a Model 3 next month and am looking at home charging options. I immediately lent to favouring the Tesla Wall Charger, mainly because 'branding'. 

However some electricians who have quoted are suggesting others such as the Zappi V2.

I have no objection to a non-Tesla charger providing I am not missing out on key benefits but am not clear if there are any major ones. 

The only one I've really known so far is that a non-Tesla charger won't open the port cover automatically. No biggy. But I'm more concerned about missing out on something more important, like over the air software updates, the ability to stop and start charging via an app, setting the car to stop charging at a certain point, etc. 

If it makes any difference, I am in the UK and the charger would be on an external wall, unprotected from the elements.

I once accidentally hanged up on a call that was impossible to call back directly to (it was some customer service's corporate line that only shows the representative number), pretty frustrating to say the least.

Hello,  I am going to give you a quick tour of my Tesla widget for Android.

I had a previous widget, but saw this concept from user u/d7mtg and was inspired to create my own for Android.

This is not for sale, just a quick look of what you can do with Tasker and KWGT. If there is plenty of interest, I will do several tutorials oh how to do this.

First, here are the requirements for this widget:

You need:

· Android OS

· Tasker

· Tasker Plugin for Tesla

· KWGT Pro

You’ll also need some basic understating of Tasker and KWGT and how it works.

You can watch the video here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApAPTX4qm0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApAPTX4qm0)

&#x200B;

Below you will find the link for the tasker project that includes all the profiles and tasks I used.

&#x200B;

 

Widget is here:

Just import to KWGT

&#x200B;

The video part 1 that describes how this works is here:

[https://youtu.be/2elnen3SzMk](https://youtu.be/2elnen3SzMk)

You will need to have some knowledge of Tasker and KWGT to configure this, but if you do, it shouldn’t be that difficult.

If you make any improvements or have any suggestions, please share with the community and let us know how to improve it. This is a personal project, so I am not doing anything special and releasing anything else besides what I have released today.

Enjoy!",59,2020-07-22 07:18:57,356

Given that a Model 3 is \~40k, and you can use it to generate yearly profits that are \~30k, wouldn't that mean that the demand for a Model 3 will become virtually infinite? There's no other asset out there that can generate \~100% return on investment. Will Tesla simply hike up the price of the Model3 to 200k, until the market settles down at least?

If that happens, it's easy to see how this would be a 20k stock.",5,2020-07-22 17:48:27,361
Love my new Model 3 but the sales/ordering process is a joke - a summary of my experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hval7w/love_my_new_model_3_but_the_salesordering_process/,"TL/DR - just about every aspect of ordering and delivery didn't work properly due to apparent technical issues on Tesla's side. And our dog peed in the new car.

I've been working in customer success roles in technology companies for over 20 years and I'm surprised with how messy my experience was...

Late last year, my wife and I decided it was time to replace our aging two door hatchback and we wanted to go electric for a variety of reasons. I initially reached out via the web form to our local Tesla service station around 20km from my house. 3 months later, I got a first reply (like I'd emailed them yesterday). Shortly thereafter, COVID hit and things slowed down.

A few months later, as things eased here in Canada, I booked a test drive and we decided that a model 3 was the right choice for us. Test drive was good and advisor was helpful and organized. By this time, I had registered on the tesla web side.

Went to put down a deposit to order a car on the web site. Entered my credit card info and the payment could not be processed. Phoned my credit card company and they had no record of the transaction attempt. Called Tesla and they made a few suggestions. Tried another card, etc to no avail. Called the card company again and they still had no record of my now multiple attempts and said the issue was not on their side. Tried a different browser (was using Chrome on Win 10 - switched to Edge) and created a new account with a different email. Now it went through on the same card.

Onto the next step. Setting up registration, delivery and payment information. But the web site wouldn't let me click the button. Another call into Tesla. They had to manually enter an address that I could then edit. This somehow gave me access to enter the rest of the details. Ok.

Then came the insurance step - proof we have insurance. We just put the deposit down and don't have a VIN assigned so don't have insurance for the Tesla yet - what insurance do they want? Existing insurance? Page didn't state what they wanted so I put in our policy on our current car which seemed to be ok.

Ok, 5-9 weeks for delivery so the wait begins. Nothing in inventory locally. Contacted an electrician to install the 14-50 outlet in my garage for fast charging but knowing he's busy, said we just need it done in the next few weeks. No problem.

I hate waiting, so I'm anxiously watching the app for my VIN assignment just to see progress. Days pass. Exactly one week from placing the deposit, we get a call. Car is in and can be picked up on Monday! They send over the paperwork including the VIN. Since this must be a surprise inventory vehicle, I'm a bit concerned that it doesn't have the wireless charger and new USB ports and call Tesla to check on build date. Eventually, they check and it is a newer build so all is well. At the same time, I inquire about buying the 14-50 adapter and adding a referral code to my purchase (no problem on the referral). But nope, they don't stock accessories - must order online from Tesla in the US (1 week for delivery). Strange, but ok.

Message my electrician and he can fit me in next week for more urgent charge outlet install. Just as well that the adapter isn't in until next week anyway.

So we go and pick up the car. Quick inspection, minor/hidden paint chip is fixed while we wait and we're good to go. Delivery specialist person informs us that their internet is down and so can't send us PDF of agreements but we get hard copies. NBD.

Go home, I'm fiddling with getting everything setup and look into the app. Discover that the car is still not marked delivered. Also a pending update is stuck downloading. Check online via PC - same. Phone the delivery center and somehow get somebody at another location who transfers me into oblivion where the call gets dropped. Try again and get voicemail. So try various numbers and get through to a support person at corporate after waiting for 20 minutes. She's great but can't mark my car delivered - must be done by the place I picked it up. But she pushed the update for me.

Next day, still not marked delivered. Waiting on that. Can't configure Premium Connectivity or my wife's account until the car is marked delivered.

Oh, and it looks like the referral code didn't work or at least no credit was applied.

Topping it all off, our first drive was to pick up our kids and take our puppy to the dog park. She peed in the new car (just on the car seat so easy to clean up).

\*\*\* Update - within 30 seconds of submitting this post, I get an email about connectivity and it appears my car is now delivered! Phew.",44,2020-07-22 04:32:06,362

Michigan insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hvu2qi/michigan_insurance/,"Michigan has ridiculously high insurance because for years they’ve required unlimited medical benefit coverage as well as being a NoFault state (meaning YourFault)...

So i know insurance will be expensive but i’m interested in how much of a premium i would have to pay for a Tesla.

For a Model Y, how much more can you expect to pay per six months vs a $50k non-Tesla car?

I imagine it’s more because all the sensors and gadgetry tends to increase insurance (looking at you Subie)

Also, does charging at home increase home insurance costs (assuming my insurance company who i use for auto and home would figure out there’s gonna be a charger installed in the garage...)

2013 85kwh Model S vs 2020 Model Y Performance,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hupz2m/2013_85kwh_model_s_vs_2020_model_y_performance/,"We purchased a Model S in 2013. It’s been my daily driver for the past 7 years and \~92,000 miles. We’ve been happy enough with it that my wife decided to get a Tesla when it was time for her new car. She could have had an X or S, but she picked the Y.  

We’ve had it for a few weeks now and thought I would share some thoughts. 

**Short version:**  No surprise, a new Model Y is an overall better car than a 7 year old Model S. Of course, you can get a used 2013 Tesla for less than a new Model Y, so I guess the market agrees. That said, money aside, a new Model S is still the best Tesla IMHO. Obviously, my wife disagrees. 😊

**Details:**

**Buying/delivery experience** – Buying our Model S in 2013 was a big deal. Pick up including the whole factory tour and someone patiently going over every detail. Buying the Model Y was the opposite. It was like click, click, wait 4 weeks, go to pick up, someone says ‘yep, it’s over there’, drive away.  In some ways, I preferred doing it that way, but it’s still a bit anti-climactic.

**Initial quality** – We had several issues with our Model S to start with. Even some dings when we accepted delivery. Main issues covered by warranty over time, but still.  Given the quarter end rush and Model Y being new, I expected more of the same. I spent at least 30 minutes looking for issues before we even took delivery. However, I haven’t been able to find a single issue with the Model Y. No problems at all over the last few weeks, either functionally or cosmetically. The build quality seems solid all around. I know some folks have been complaining online, but we have had zero issues so far (knock on wood).

**Exterior design** – I still like my Model S better, but honestly the Model Y looks great in person. Much better in person than online. Better than the X or 3 IMHO and my wife thinks it’s the best looking Tesla.

**Interior design** – Again, I prefer the look of the interior of the Model S. The dual screen set up with the larger center screen makes the interior feel more complete and functional. That said, the center screen on the Model Y is just fine and is surprisingly natural to drive with the one center console.   
The seats and seating position on the Model Y are much better. Not only are you physically sitting in a more comfortable position, but the seats themselves are more comfortable. I understand newer Model S’s have better seats, but the 2013 seats are not great. That said, easier to stretch out on a Model S given the increased size.   
I think storage is better in the Model S, even though the total cubic feet may be better in the Y. Model Y is taller, but Model S is wider and that seems more important for most stuff.   
There is less wind noise in the Model S, but both are great.   
Visibility is better in the Y.

**Driving experience** – Model Y is quicker on paper and NOTICEABLY quicker in person. Super fun to zip around and I would rather be in the Model Y both for long trips and around town. Autopilot is a plus, but for me I only want to use it in stop and go traffic or on a long steady stretch of highway. Handling is great with the Y. Main area I would give the nod to the 2013 Model S is on sweeping high speed roads. Again, with a new Model S, I think the overall equation would change with more range, faster speed, better seats.

**Battery** – The Performance Model Y w/ the Performance Upgrade Package and my 2013 Model S have almost the same range. When I bought the Model S, the range was 266 miles. Since then, it went to a top of 290 miles as Tesla pushed out improvements to battery management. Now it maxes around 284 and the Y with PUP is 280.  
Side note - I love driving by my neighbor every day who told me when I bought the Model S that I would have to buy a new battery pack in 3 years. 😊

**Value for money** – yeah, Model Y. No question.

**My next car** – So the wife gets the Model Y. Again, she preferred it over a new Model S, but personally I do not.  For me, my 2013 is still going strong, it's paid off and I am in no hurry.  By the time I need to replace it, I think it will be between the nextgen Model S or a CyberTruck.",131,2020-07-21 05:52:27,373
Note about Tesla Insurance and Moving,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/huyhhh/note_about_tesla_insurance_and_moving/,"Last week I read about folks starting to receive their rebates on their insurance policies that Tesla promised due to COVID-19. I hadn’t received anything yet, so I gave Tesla Insurance a call. I moved to a new residence since I first signed up for my policy. I updated my address in my Tesla account right when I moved, and I figured all was well. Turns out, Tesla Insurance doesn’t refer to your address on record in your Tesla account. There is no way to update your address with Tesla Insurance online. The representative told me that my rebate check was sent to my old address, and then asked me to provide him with my new one. When I let him know that I thought I had already updated my address via my account on Tesla.com, he said they don’t look at that and the only way to update it is to call them. Kind of annoying, and I could see others making this same mistake. Just wanted to let ya’ll know!

TLDR: If you move and you have Tesla Insurance, the only way to update your address is to call them during business hours. Updating via Tesla account at Tesla.com doesn’t work.",31,2020-07-21 13:43:19,374

Strangest Delivery Experience,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/husp80/strangest_delivery_experience/,"I got a call last Thursday from Tesla telling me my Model Y is here at the Ottawa service centre ready for delivery, we scheduled to pick up the vehicle at 1 pm today.

Weekend - Party time baby! Recharges to a higher level anytime on a weekend we plug in the car. 

Nightly - The regular after x:xx pm cheap recharge we know and love.

0 down model Y lease,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hvidv5/0_down_model_y_lease/,"Hi - I’m looking to finally make the move to an EV. I typically only drive 12k miles a year so I’ve leased every vehicle I’ve ever had. I have always put down $0 because with a lease it’s the smart move - if you total the thing driving it off the parking lot you are SOL with any down payment. 

I’m looking at this model Y lease that’s been making the news over the past week. 4.5k down $500 a month. 

Does Tesla offer flexibility with a down payment. Do they allow you to build it into the monthly payment instead? It’s not a dealbreaker but preferred method for me. 

I have a 820 credit score if that has any impact.

Traffic light and stop sign bug?,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hukxsl/traffic_light_and_stop_sign_bug/,"I’m not sure if this has been posted before but I’ve noticed an odd bug in the two more recent updates (I’m on 2020.24.6.9). While in autopilot heading straight through a green light (no one in front of me) I’ll acknowledge the light is green and the car will proceed about 200 feet and then decide to slow down again with the light still green. This happens consistently at almost every light on a particular road. There is good visibility of the lights and the car “knows” they’re green (the stop bar stays green after I acknowledge) but for whatever reason it just decides to slow down again. I have tested the full behavior without intervention and the car will noticeably slow down, go through the intersection, and speed up again. Sometimes I see it place another stop bar ahead of the car on the opposite side of the intersection. I don’t know if it sees both sets of lights as a new intersection or what but it drives me crazy. The car acts fine when there is a lead car and no confirmation is required.

Lane assist / lane departure avoidance not working,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/huq6nv/lane_assist_lane_departure_avoidance_not_working/,"\*\*\* Updates will be at the bottom

Hi guys

Did not really see any threads calling this out.  Just a handful youtube videos from about a year ago.

We have a brand new Model 3, picked up June 2020.  We have Lane Assist on and Lane Departure Avoidance turned on.  There's actually 2 settings, but both are on.

Tried testing this out over the weekend and were quite astonished that it simply does not work.  I was going over the double yellow lines, dashed highway lines and solid white shoulder lines.  Not once did I notice either a bump back to the center lane or any on screen notifications which I saw on the youtube videos (even there it was not frequent).  I tried with hands on the wheel and hands off but as soon as I went over the lines I took over.

Anyone else noticed this?  Figure this has to be a software issue possibly.  Mostly interested if anyone else can confirm it works and what software version are you on?  Maybe there's a bug on my current version.

We're on Version 2020.20.12

\*\*\*\* Updates \*\*\*\*

update 1:      So we got a software update overnight on version 2020.24.6.9 now.  A different issue is that Connecticut DMV has been slow to get my real plates to me.  Currently on temps which expired EOD yesterday.  Tesla is providing a new temp plate/registration for another month thankfully.  Hope to test out the functionality later or tomorrow.  Thanks to u/jefferios for replying saying his experience was a bug that was fixed in a later version.  Hoping to experience some better responsiveness in the next drive.",9,2020-07-21 06:03:15,390

Odd - rocks under the glass,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/husi24/odd_rocks_under_the_glass/,"I noticed something odd the other day. The rear windshield of our X has a couple of small rocks trapped under it, tightly. This is at the bottom of the glass where it meets the rear hatch, under the spoiler. The rocks are stuck tight, and I'm not sure how they got there. 

I assume they're road debris kicked up from traffic, rolled down the rear glass, and entered from the bottom corner where there's a bit more of a gap. Then as the car drove and the glass/hatch flexed and warped, the gaps temporarily widened to let the rocks migrate around and get lodged in tight.  Anyone else experience this? Any suggestions to get them out?

Sentry Cam huge design flaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hubyvi/sentry_cam_huge_design_flaw/,"Yesterday my Model 3 was hit while parked at a friend's house by a neighbor backing out.

Cops came at 8pm (non emergency and slower due to covid). After cop left at 9pm I drove home. I started to check my Sentry footage from the model 3. I was blown away it was not saved. It showed footage of my drive home (dashcam), and other Sentry clips of people walking by at random parking lots (for few months out), BUT NO FOOTAGE FROM THE ALARM TRIGGERED EVENT. Since i didn't pull the footage immediately it was overridden. I have a 120gb ssd and shows 70gb free on it. Why does Tesla Sentry cam not save alarm triggered event footage??????  Why does it not fill up the empty drive space and then override the oldest footage that is not saved?  It doesn't have footage from over 24hrs ago. Thank God my friend had house cameras which also caught the incident (need to send copy to police). But I'm disappointed that Tesla Sentry mode didn't save that accident footage. For anyone reading this, make sure to recover your footage asap.  For any Tesla engineer reading this, please save footage from alarm triggered events on storage drive (teslacam\saved clips). 

TLDR; my model 3 got hit, triggered Sentry alarm event on my phone and car made alarm sounds. Teslacam footage help me identify person who hit me in car; but when i got home to check footage off ssd, it was gone.",142,2020-07-20 13:02:42,393

"Traffic-Aware Cruise Control - PICK CURRENT SPEED, not max",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/huggho/trafficaware_cruise_control_pick_current_speed/,"[https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/model\_3\_owners\_manual\_north\_america\_en.pdf](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/model_3_owners_manual_north_america_en.pdf)

PAGE 94 - "" Set the Cruising Speed To set the cruising speed, move the cruise control lever fully down once then release. This sets the cruising speed to the **detected speed limit** (plus any offset you've specified using Speed Assist as described in Controlling Speed Assist on page 134) or your current driving speed, whichever is greater. ""

Please don't try to detect, just take the car's **current speed**. I don't know any other car going full zerg.

\*) it takes 1x tap on the speedometer icon to set it to 'detected speed limit'\*) it takes 10x scroll down to reduce from 130 km/h to 80 (typical highway speeds in Europe and limits during nearby traffic obstacles)\*) Germany Autobahn - no limit - so 150 km/h - 90 mp/h - not every nutjob travels at speed of sound,  another 10 scrolls down to get to sane speed

&#x200B;

10 scrolls - need to be done clean, and slow-ish, otherwise wont count - 10 scrolls - at least 5 and more seconds  - that's like 500+ meters in high panic mode.

And not to forget WRONG MAP INFORMATION - so many roads (at least in my area) have different speeds that DETECTED SPEED LIMIT (tm) (( ... ))

**EDITed:** after just one hour quite some votes alreadey - showing both modes should exist so a friendly **Request Update** here: Make it an OPTION in DRIVE SETTING - ""Cruise Control \[**(CURRENT)**    (MAX)\] ""(i) -> ""Select current vehicle speed or the detected speed limit as your cruise control speed""

Model 3 SR range test,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hudjsx/model_3_sr_range_test/,"This is the SR model with rated 220 mile range

&#x200B;

Bought car in march, 1000 on odometer, charged to 100%, switched to chill mode, drove mostly 55-72 mph.

100%/212mi at start of trip. 

36%/75mi range left at end of trip

136.7 mi and 27kWh at 199 Wh/mi. 

I stopped once to pee and a second time to pick up groceries for 20 mins. AC was set to 77, central FL driving so hot and flat. 4-7pm time frame.

Battery Regen braking worked right away with SR, which is cool.

136.7 mi / 64% of battery used =  2.135 mi for each percent of battery. 2.135 x 100 = 213.5 miles (my predicted range)

My plan was to drive to 5% but I was happy enough with the numbers I was seeing.

I am surprised that at 199 Wh/mi I am not seeing a higher range but overall ok with the outcome.

I have been averaging 235 Wh/mi before this test.

New Model 3/Y Competitor,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/huboyb/new_model_3y_competitor/,"Was just watching the YouTube videos on the polestar 2 (specifically Autogefuhl) and couldn't help but be envious of some features.   

The big features I see that it has that the model 3 doesn't are as follows:  

1.) Gauge cluster with native Google maps.   
2.) App store ( would love to be able to dl Sirius XM and audible and my favorite podcasting app)     
3.) Really good 360 cams  
4.) Better blind spot monitoring in mirrors.   


That all said I still prefer my model 3. Especially with the supercharger network but I know in Europe it's not a huge issue given the large amounts of third party networks.   

Hopefully Tesla having some real competition in the sector will light a fire under their butts to add some features like an app store with 3rd party apps and better blind spot monitoring when changing lanes.  


Edit* - Not sure I get the reports of my rule violations for the post but I guess people don't like hearing of Tesla competitors. My model 3 is awesome and I'm sure my cybertruck will be the same as well but liking Tesla a lot doesn't mean you can't look objectively at the competition and say ""hey that looks cool, not cool enough for me to buy it but I wish I had that feature"".I think it's good to see the competition is finally stepping up their game. The polestar is some of the best competition to date that Tesla will have in my opinion and it's still not good enough, Tesla beats it in so many areas but not all. Figured it might be good to discuss the areas it doesn't best it but I guess not. Hate post and downvote away lol",13,2020-07-20 12:44:20,412
TPMS Failure - Switched to Performance 20s and TPMS no longer work,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/huewrf/tpms_failure_switched_to_performance_20s_and_tpms/,"Hi All,

I tried doing the factory reset, I tried choosing new wheel configurations but i still get an error message stating ""TPMS Failure - it may resolve itself on its own""

I guess I'm now 'this guy': Let me tell you about my Tesla!,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hu1in3/i_guess_im_now_this_guy_let_me_tell_you_about_my/,"I submitted [this post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c2165b/i_havent_been_this_guy/) after ordering my Model 3, talking about how I'd never been a Car Guy, didn't salivate over new models and latest features and so forth. I have always liked driving, but my first Camry was an upgrade compared to cars I had owned before. I tended to buy cars new and drive them until repairs exceeded value, as opposed to trading them in because they were 'getting old'. In June last year my 16-year-old Camry had 226k, and I was proud of that and had every intention of driving it until it had 300k. 

On impulse I took a Tesla test drive one Friday lunch, and ordered one that Sunday morning (just before a tax credit deadline). Model 3, AWD LR FSD. Blue.

I felt so weird. 

So I took delivery, gave rides, played with the FSD, installed a 30A circuit at home, tried out Smart Summon, had a couple of little cosmetic repairs done. And enjoyed the heck out of it.

I've Googled roads famous for their curves -- it is SO much fun to pilot this car. I've looked into autocross, decided not until the Covid-19 stuff is less prevalent. My brother and I took an all-day trip in it just to steer it around some small mountains. Well, and use AutoPilot on the Blue Ridge Parkway...

I saw a post recently from a driver who swapped out an Audi lease for a Tesla lease, and was switching back. He(?) said there were luxury car features in the Audi that he missed, and didn't consider his Tesla all that luxurious a car. I considered and decided that, unless doing good for the environment is a major consideration, or you enjoy the acceleration, perhaps a Tesla is not for you.

But it's certainly been an exciting car for me -- I still love it. My 15-year-old self was awakened, and hasn't made it back to sleep yet. I yearn for the end of the Covid-19 crisis so I can go on some long road trips. The open road is where this car really shines. Well, and mountain-road driving. And maybe some rally work or track racing. Though I still enjoy driving it to the grocery store.

In case you're here looking for Tesla info, and therefore not familiar with the autopilot feature: let me describe Tesla's salient open road feature, Autopilot. Autopilot is to driving as old-fashioned cruise control is to maintaining your speed. 

Cruise control, until lately, would keep your car at a constant speed; it saved you having to keep your foot tensed to maintain pressure on the accelerator pedal in just the right amounts for the speed you wanted, and from having to watch the speedometer to ensure you weren't drifting up or down. I, who got used to driving without one, was surprised by how much energy and tension those two little things required, measured by how much relief I felt on cruise. It did not free me from paying attention to speed -- the ones I've used will maintain a constant speed right into the back of a truck -- but it was still a significant help.

Tesla's autopilot does the same thing for maintaining speed, following distance, and your position in your lane. It steers the car to remain in the middle of the lane, with occasional small adjustments if you're next to a big rig. The car checks often for a resistance to turning the steering wheel; if it does not find it, it reminds you that your hands are supposed to be on the wheel. It is clear you're still responsible for driving. But you don't have the constant tension of paying attention to your lane and your speed and your following distance. You still have to watch; if something unusual comes up, you need to be ready to take over immediately. But some of the things we all do anyway in non-Tesla cars -- looking down to see where the tissue box is, checking the rear seat for an umbrella or a child, heck, looking in the rearview mirror -- are now less dangerous than they were, and you don't have the constant mental effort of monitoring these specific things.

And having it change lanes for you, on command, after checking for surrounding cars, etc., is just extra! (EDIT: this feature is part of ""Full Self-Driving (FSD), not AutoPilot).

And one more note: I've described AutoPilot, not ""Full Self-Driving""; the latter is an additional feature at an additional cost. One reason I purchased FSD is that I confused it with AutoPilot, which is standard on all Tesla cars. So when you order yours, be aware there's a difference.

Anyway. It's been a year now, and I still look forward to driving ""Streak"", whether it's to the mountains or the grocery store. Other than the little cosmetic warranty things I had done in the first month, no service has been needed. I will talk about the car to anyone at the drop of a hat. Someone actually asked me if it was easy to get Tesla owners to talk about their cars; I replied quite honestly that the real problem was getting them to shut up.

I think Tesla should sell bumper stickers that say ""Let me tell you about my Tesla"". I'd buy one...",45,2020-07-20 02:39:30,417
Opinion: Pre-HW3/MCU2 European Model S OTA updates are pretty much dead,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hu5elv/opinion_prehw3mcu2_european_model_s_ota_updates/,"Just wanted to share some thoughts I've been having regarding OTA updates for European Model S (and probably Model X?) w/o HW3 and/or MCU2. Not really to complain, just to hear the community's thoughts on the matter, and ventilate a bit.

So here goes. I feel like Tesla has pretty much given up meaningful development of new and/or improved SW features for these cars. Can't even recall the last meaningful update I had. Might have been SMS integration, but due to lack of language support, it's pretty useless. NoA is also useless over here. So I'm gonna have to go with Emergency Lane Keeping, or whatever it is called? Point is, it's been a long time.

There are a number of reasons for this of course, not all of which can be attributed to Tesla. There's the slow pace of local regulation. There's the HW limits of AP2.5/MCU1 and prior. Tesla also understandably releases new features for North American countries first, and many features are only implemented in Model 3/Y, due to their newer architecture.

Now, I'm really not complaining. Tesla's OTA regime has helped my car feel new-ish for several years, and has softened it's depreciation. I love my Model S to the death, and my next car will also be a Tesla.

And yet, I can't help but feel a little disappointed and left out. I used to love getting SW updates. I would Google release notes, check my cars WiFi, read up on new features. Now, I hardly ever register new updates. It feels especially disappointing, since it's been over a year since I paid for FSD, but still have not received my HW3 retrofit. Whenever I ask Tesla about it, they have no new information about it. I'm not even sure they have done a single retrofit here in Norway. MCU2 upgrades were not available here last time I checked.

My feeling is that there's a lot of early adopters in this situation. Tesla, show us some love? :) Thanks",16,2020-07-20 06:31:56,418

"2.8 yrs old and my model S won't ""super""charge any more",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/htthw6/28_yrs_old_and_my_model_s_wont_supercharge_any/,"I had heard about this happening - after some undetermined amount of miles/charge-cycles/superchargingKWh/whoknowswhat.... your Tesla will get it's charge rate capped.  Mine no longer will charge faster than 80kW.  Most of the time it tops out around 74kW.  Today I saw 80kW after driving from 99% down to 15% SOC.  For a while I just thought I was having bad luck at SC's getting some old SC's that can't push the juice, etc.  But this has been happening for about 6 months now I think.

I can't tell you how much this sucks.  It nearly doubles the charging time.  This seriously impacts road trips.  Daily driving is no big deal, I charge overnight at home most of the time.  

My car has about 55k miles on it, and a fair amount of that (dunno how much, but given I get free unlimited SC use, it's at least half, I would estimate) was supercharged.

Anyone else get rate capped on their car yet?  At how many miles did this happen? 

Anyone have high miles on a model S and still able to charge at full speed?

Background: Sept. 2017 Model S, with HW2.5, 2wd 75kWh battery.  The highest SC rate I ever saw in this car was last summer: I charged at a Kettleman City, CA on I-5, and saw a max of 128kW charging rate.  

Has anyone heard of Tesla un-doing this charge-rate cap for anyone?  I think I'd rather sacrifice battery life, or range (mine is already down to 220mi from an as-new range of 248mi) in favor of charging speed.

Should I complain to Tesla?  Or am I (as I suspect) well within expected battery performance?",102,2020-07-19 15:00:21,425

You approach the car, it opens up, you sit down. And then you wait for the vehicle to start up. For 10, 20, 30, 40 seconds until the Tesla logo disappears and you're ready to put in Drive.

Now this is not only kind of embarassing (Other vehicles in a parking lot / colleagues requiring you to ""go first"") when you have to wait half a minute before being able to drive, it can also be extremely annoying (leaving home abruptly and in a hurry / being late already)

Did anyone experience the same and got it fixed?

Is this common on AP3 as well?

Is this even common on other models as well?",15,2020-07-19 23:24:14,427

At wit's end with a sound/mic/dash camera issue on my Model 3,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/htrl2t/at_wits_end_with_a_soundmicdash_camera_issue_on/,"**Preface**

I've had my car for almost 2 years now, taken delivery in August of 2018. Ever since I got my car there's been an ongoing issue with my sound. There were also numerous other issues as well which Tesla, for the most part, resolved. However this issue has been with me since the beginning. I must have mentioned it to the service team a dozen times.


**The Issue**

The issue is that when my car wakes up for deep sleep, there's a 50/50 (though lately it seems to be 100%) chance that sound will not initialize. This also causes the microphone to not initialize, as well as the dash cam (however, rear camera works). This will persist indefinitely throughout the ride until I park, undo my seatbelt, open my door, and close it again; after which all systems will initialize properly.


 **Tesla support**

Tesla support has been largely unhelpful in resolving my issue. Every time I take my car in for service they tell me ""it will be fixed in a software update"". Nearly two years later, it still hasn't. I never put too much worry into it as a thought ""I'll be getting hardware v3 later, so I guess that should solve it!"". I sent my car in for service for the included upgrade at time of purchase and had all my settings and AP calibration reset (as per usual for the upgrade I assumed). However, after getting my car back, I realized the issue still happened, and with seemingly increased frequency. Tesla now makes it harder than ever to get support through email, phone, chat, instead opting for service scheduling only for any kind of help, which further compounds my frustration.


At this point I'm not sure what to do, as Tesla doesn't seem to want to help me, and often threatens me with diagnostic fees if they inspect my car and find ""no fault"". I've been asked in the past to provide exact times of when the problem occurred, but those timestamps didn't seem to help them at all. I've tried hard resets (brake + two steering wheel buttons for 30+ seconds until the T comes back on the infotainment screen) and even a whole car reset from the hardware upgrade. I've been dealing with it for now, but it's become a safety concern for me as I no longer have dashcam, no longer have sound cues, and no longer have a working microphone if I get into an accident where I cannot move.


Any suggestions or guidance from the community would be appreciated.",6,2020-07-19 12:43:26,440
Referral System,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/htkihu/referral_system/,"So I just bought a 2nd Tesla and forgot to use my referral link however I was logged into my account and Tesla is refusing to give me referral credit for this order. 

On top of that, I referred another person who ended up going to a physical location to place the order and told them I referred him. They told him that they would add my link but never did. 

I contacted the referral people and they said they wouldn't give me credit for these orders because it would not be fair... How does that make any sense? Without me they would've sold 2 less cars and I'm getting no credit for it. How is that fair?

Since I have a home charger setup I'm not really worried about not getting the supercharging credit, but my friend lives in NYC and will be relying on super chargers for 100% of his charging and using my referral was gonna help him out a bit.

Now I noticed that in the notes on TeslaFi for 2020.28.2 it says:

“Your car will automatically disable the passenger face vents when no passenger is detected, lowering energy consumption in hot weather. This vent can be manually enabled by tapping where you’d like the passenger face vent to direct air within the climate control panel,” the 2020.28.2 release notes stated. 

So it seems like there is a way to actually close the front vents independently of one another, but will we be given this option even if there is a passenger?",16,2020-07-18 19:52:39,456

"White Model Y Paint Mottling, Tiger Stripes and yellow bumper",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ht66s8/white_model_y_paint_mottling_tiger_stripes_and/,"(Re-posting as single thread based on moderator request)

I have been noticing significant tiger stripes and mottling on the doors and hood on a majority of Model Ys. Now that I am aware of it, I can even see this in Youtube videos featuring the white Model Y.

The issue seems to be more/less visible depending on the light. It is almost completely unnoticeable on an overcast day and very visible when you are looking at the car from the same angle the sun is shining at it, particularly when the sun comes in at a lower angle (e.g. in the morning).

I have tried for multiple months now to get Tesla to fix this and they took the car in 5 times now, but did not resolve the issue on any of the attempts.

Was wondering if anyone had any luck getting this fixed on Tesla's dime? My local Tesla certified body shop said this will be straight forward to fix, but they have to repaint and blend the doors, which won't be cheap and Tesla refuses to cover the repairs, quoting their warranty, which does not cover any paint issues that only affect appearance.

I have also noticed many Model Ys, including mine, have a very strong yellow tint to their rear bumper. Has anyone been able to get this repainted by Tesla to match the body better, similar to how it matches much better on the Model 3?",49,2020-07-18 11:16:56,459

Issues after mobile service installed loaner wheel,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ht5ocl/issues_after_mobile_service_installed_loaner_wheel/,"Less than 500 miles and I got a flat. Bad one, tire needs replaced. None in stock, so mobile service put on a loaner wheel for the time being, and put mine in the trunk.

As soon as I set off, things acted funny. No regenerative braking. Traction control keeps flashing yellow at me. No autopilot/cruise. But the most troublesome is a clicking/rattling coming from near my feet. It sounds like the computer trying to fire the brakes. I tried calling back the mobile service tech, but he just kept saying that if there's no vibration, I'm safe, and that he put the right size wheel on. Wouldn't seem to listen and actually address my issue.

Also the TPMS system hasn't picked up the sensor in the new wheel after about 20 minutes of driving home. Seems unusual, but not threatening.

Lastly, when I finally got home, I was unloading stuff and noticed the replaced wheel is quite noticably hotter. Just standing next to it feeling the heat radiate into my legs, it was far more than any other wheel. At this point, I finally notice that the tire size doesn't match the rest of my wheels. So the tech did not install a matching wheel size.

I've concluded that since the smaller loaner wheel rotates faster than the others at the same speed, it's causing havoc with the traction control, which is trying to apply brakes to that wheel to slow it down, hence the noise at my feet and the heat at the wheel.

I plan to call the service center and get something set up to fix this tomorrow. By the way, how do you actually speak to a human on their frustrating automatic menu? 

But in the meantime, can anyone else confirm my suspicions? Has anyone else experienced anything like this? And did anything likely lead to unnecessary damage?",26,2020-07-18 10:46:11,463

DIY Wall connector install,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hsyp85/diy_wall_connector_install/,"I just received my wall connector and I am now in the process of installing it.

Just a quick disclaimer: I myself am comfortable with electricity, I've always done my own wiring, I do not recommend doing this on your own without an electrician.

My situation is a little different from the rest I have seen in the forum as I do not have a garage, instead I have a fenced in property. The area where I park the car is across my back yard and about 70 ft from the house - a total of 80 ft from the electrical panel.

Since my panel is maxed out I am having to install a sub panel and re-arrange a couple breakers.

Given this the cost of hiring an electrician is likely going to be astronomical due to the need of adding a sub-panel, install conduit and run underground wiring over a long distance.

Here is my plan and I'd greatly appreciate any input on the process and the type of wiring I should use, I'll be listing the costs in case anyone is curious.

1- Remove 2 breakers from the main panel and install a 100 amp breaker which will feed a sub-panel.  
I was told I can use 6/2 wiring to connect the panel however I'm ~~a little~~ very skeptical on this information.  


The cost of the sub-panel and the breakers (100 amp for the box, 60 amp for the wall connector) is $95.

2- Run conduit from the sub-panel, up a wall and under the roof lip about 10 ft then down the wall and into the ground about 70 ft to a shed were the charger will be installed slightly exposed to the elements. This step will likely be done simultaneously as step 3 so I don't have to push wire over one long distance.

Approximate cost of the conduit is $170.

3- Run 3 cables, two hot one ground - I was told for 220 to use 6/2 (#6 awg).  
The cost for the wiring will be around $220.

My expected investment is $485 in materials and $500 for the wall connector total $1053.95 with tax.

Does this plan sound right to you? Am I missing anything?",1,2020-07-18 04:24:01,476
