You could be dirt-poor and still be able to play some of the best games out there legally! I find it baffling how many people are complaining about Civ 6. It may not be your jam, but you cannot argue that this is categorically a super well regarded title, its the latest one in the series, and you got it for free!

Does Epic get free licenses for these games? There's no way they could afford to pay MSRP for these games and give them out to everyone.

This is like the best kept secret in PC gaming. Someone who is on a budget could rely on the Epic Games free games to fill their backlog and never run out.",382,2020-09-04 12:41:18,33

***1 - For the cracked Verison***

&#x200B;

As i see there is so much GTA V Cracked Owners

You will do the same steps as i wrote down

but The only Extra thing u need to do is to delete The Crack Files (Avoiding Any possible Ban)

&#x200B;

The Cracked Files Name's(  GTA5.exe - GTAVLauncher.exe - socialclub.dll - socialclub.ini - steam\_api.ini -  steam\_api64.dll- steam\_api\_ext64.dll - [steam000.wow](https://steam000.wow/)  \-   [steam001.wow](https://steam001.wow) )

and continue as i wrote down

&#x200B;

***2 - For The Steam Verison***

&#x200B;

Now First You will make a copy from the steam verison (Backup)

take the back up from (SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V)

After Doing a backup

&#x200B;

1 - go to Epic games store And Select where u want to download the game

once u select where u want it installed and start the download

2 - let it download like 5MB or so

3 - pause the download and exit Epic games launcher (fully exit)

4 - Now go and cut/copy the backup u did (COPY THE RAW FILES / Like i copied them In the pic below)

&#x200B;

Like this

After copying them

5 - Now Open the GTAV folder( The one that Epic games launcher made)

&#x200B;

you will see 1 file only (.egstore) DO NOT DELETE OR MOVEIT)

&#x200B;

6 - Paste the raw files on GTAV (Epic games gtav folder)

Like this

https://preview.redd.it/tiyg7nw66uy41.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc0fb80e1a7ce3272b10b7c40118482c8108b596

Now for the tricky part

7 - Open Epic Games Launcher and resume the download

Now here u will see it is didnt work and it didnt verify the files

Dont Panic

8 - Cancel The Download and go to ur library

&#x200B;

9 - u will see Grand theft auto V and there is a small word under its pic says (Resume)

&#x200B;

10 - Now Press Resume and wait

DON4T WORRY ABOUT BUYING A GAME BECAUSE IT MIGHT GO FREE OR ON SALE!!! ( Epic will refund you the difference),https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glkyzp/don4t_worry_about_buying_a_game_because_it_might/,"Epic partial refunds might actually be the best unknown feature of EGS. you should never worry about buying a game again because as long as you bought the game six weeks before it going free or getting discounted, you'll get a refund of the difference in price.

EGS basically fixed the problem of gamers hesitating when buying a game. To my knowledge it is the only store that does this

I just had to post this because i see so many people afraid that they might be wasting their money. so please stop making posts about this,YOU WILL GET A GODDAMN REFUND....ffs

EDIT: there seems to be articles saying that it's actually only 2 weeks before hand. this seems to contradict the refunds that people got for world war z which seem to go back as far as february 13th which was 6 weeks before it was offered for free.hope epic can just clarify the duration for much less confusion.

here take a look:

[https://www.similarweb.com/website/steampowered.com?competitors=epicgames.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/steampowered.com?competitors=epicgames.com)

this will most likely change soon enough and steam will surpass epic again in june because of the steam summer sale but its really interesting to see the growth of EGS.

there are other sites that do this like alexa ranks but that site uses 90 day stats and doesn't work in this instance

basically EGS is growing at a fast rate. hopefully we can see the same in terms of feature developpement...probably not",248,2020-06-09 13:11:03,72

I still remember bitching when I was forced to DL it to play Empire TW. Its grown on me though. The sales, the workshop and review system are all top notch. 

I didnt know much about Epic until the Batman series was free. What a score! But I uninstalled. As they continue to give us great games I've grown more appreciative to the point that I bought a game. Now Ark is free the type of game I've been interested in but wouldnt buy because my video game funds are limited. 

Basically all of that to say thank you Epic. Your strategy is working. Keep being generous, it's hard to get us to play less on steam. But over time it can happen. Freshen up the UI some, get an inhouse review system and same for mods. Cheers!",241,2020-06-12 23:15:47,76

so what can you do in offline mode and what is the purpose of offline mode?

Once I am on the store page, and able to see the video of the game, if I want to install the game, I currently have to go back to the library.

Going back to the library resets the scroll bar to the top of the list, and I have to go down the list to find the game again.

This can be remedied in a few different ways:  
1) Allow viewing the store video/picture/text on the library page.

2) Change the ""Owned"" button to ""Install"", and allow installing the game from the store button.

3) Don't reset the scroll bars to the top every time I go to the library.

EPIC won me over,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hgegds/epic_won_me_over/,"Few months ago: I didn't care about the newest outrage:  ""Steam vs Epic"". Of course every comment that was in favor of epic was downvoted to hell and in favor of steam upvoted - typical reddit echo chamber, not surprising.

It was a bit cringe though how people acted and still act like we are in a action movie, where everything is black and white - steam the good guys / epic the bad guys.

In my eyes both are grey, like nearly everyone and everything in life actually

Weren't interested in taking any sides, both are companies that just want my money in the end, so I choose whats most beneficial for me, not for the company

At the time that was steam - I had all my games that I accumulated over the years there, a lot of money already invested in my collection.

Then I noticed the free games, which I saw as really nice move of EPIC, super beneficial to the consumer (me) - great games even, not those trash 50 cent indie games that are always given away on other sites, so it looks like they are generous, but in reality they give you the biggest shittiest trash available.

No - it were mostly highly rated good games.

Always grabbed them but thought ""I will probably only use EPIC to play those free games every now and then, still going to continue to buy and build my collection on steam"" - because well like I said most of my collection was already there and I didn't see a reason to move

...And then they started with the 10‚Ç¨ coupons and won me over, I bought multiple games at insane prices... like I am not overreacting - with the 10‚Ç¨ coupon + the running sale you could get games for the lowest price ever recorded for those games, on any store. Not rarely even cheaper than black market keys

I bought like around 100‚Ç¨ worth of games and now Steam and EPIC are equals in my book, I am now going to build my game collection on both EQUALLY, where-ever its cheaper.

EPIC still has a lot to improve upon, but I really like how they didn't just wedge themselves into the market, but also really reward the consumer for buying and staying with them

&#x200B;

""They don't care about you!! They are just doing it for the marketing!! To win you over!!!"" - yeah no shit, like I said at the beginning, EPIC and Steam are both companies that don't give much real shits about anyone of you or me.

Yet I am profiting of their marketing.

I don't give a fuck about the INTENTION of their action, I give a fuck about the RESULT of their action which is FREE GAMES + insane deals and prices

&#x200B;

Lastly I think a lot of you will see yourself in that story. How you first thought you would always stay at steam, but epic just kept churning out awesome things until they ""won you over"" and you started to buy games from them

EPIC and Steam are both good and bad - competition like that will in most cases profit us, the consumer. Because one thing is certain: Steam had it too cozy in the past.",201,2020-06-27 07:40:50,97
An actual fix for the insanely slow download/update speeds of Epic Games Launcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/inufea/an_actual_fix_for_the_insanely_slow/,"Hey!   
So I got extremely frustrated that a game I wanted to download was sitting at 10kb/s or some stupid number like that (even though everything else I do runs at normal and high speeds), and after trying all the guides, I finally figured out the actual way to fix it with every detail covered. Most of the guides were good, but lacked crucial steps.   
So here it is:  


1. **Don't** have the launcher open.

2. Locate C:\\Users\\You\\AppData\\Local\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Config\\Windows (or whatever it looks like for you, you might need to <show> the hidden folders like AppData if it isn't there)

3. Open the Engine.ini file (it will only be here if you've downloaded and opened the launcher at least once before)

4. It should be empty, and either way, paste in (as the only text in the file):  


\[HTTP\] HttpTimeout=10 HttpConnectionTimeout=10 HttpReceiveTimeout=10 HttpSendTimeout=10

\[Portal.BuildPatch\]  
ChunkDownloads=5  
ChunkRetries=20  
RetryTime=0.5  


5. Save

6. Right click the Engine.ini, properties, enable Read-only, apply, close

7. Now, reboot your pc

8. Open Epic Games Launcher, and test if it helped (both for the launcher updates themselves, and for game downloads and updates).   


I've already had a couple other people tell me they had this slow download speed issue, and that this exact thing fixed it for them, so I hope it helps someone else out there equally frustrated.  


**The one thing I was missing in the beginning was to reboot my PC, so remember that.**  


Any questions are welcome. I am by no means a tech wizard, but goddamn do I get determined to fix things that inconvenience me!

Epic Games store is the prime example for buying friends,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hxc1kg/epic_games_store_is_the_prime_example_for_buying/,"The thing about the epic games store is, that you can't really use it. I really want the epic games store to be good but nothing has changed since release, and giving free games to gain users is not a long-term solution.
So I wanted to play Escapists with some of my friends, but as it turns out: Epic Games does not even have an invite system. The map editor is also not available because of the missing features for modding.
Does anyone seriously use epic to message friends? I mean the chat is not really that good either.
Epic should stop buying their customers, but instead do something so the customers come to them.
Buying games on the other big platform (except for offline games without a modding community) is the much smarter choice for now, even if you had to pay 5$ more. I just can't see anyone seriously using this platform as of now.

So please epic, improve the user experience and don't turn into uplay or origin. Because epic is just like them for now.",188,2020-07-25 11:07:38,104

"The Captcha for the launcher is terrible, please improve it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ilbu7y/the_captcha_for_the_launcher_is_terrible_please/,"There's something weird going on with this Captcha. Basically there is a maze with a cheese and a mouse. You have to click on the mouse that can't reach the cheese in the maze. There are six images to choose from. You have to do five of these. Then after you finish all five, it jumps to 5/10.

After I finished 10/10, it told me I was incorrect. Not only a time-waste but frustrating. So I tried it again, same thing happened. I swear this isn't me, I'm clicking on the mouse that obviously can't get to the bitmap looking cheese.

Edit: In reality, it might actually be me... but it's still a brutal ass captcha, you're talking about 100% consistency here for 60 mazes. More below...

[https://imgur.com/a/jF1HxbN](https://imgur.com/a/jF1HxbN)

Loaded up the launcher to install GTA V but I suppose I'll try this again later.

Edit: After one full hour, I managed to solve to get into the launcher. You have 15-20 seconds to do each set and have six mazes in each set, one of them is where the mouse can't get to the cheese. You have 10 of these so that's a total of 60 mazes. Some mazes are really complex, it gets even worse if there's multiple of them with the extremely harsh time limit.

The worst thing of all is that you have to be 100% correct. If even 9/10 of them are correct then you won't be able to get into the launcher. You literally have to have the speed of a robot here, it doesn't help that the maze corridors are extremely narrow, we're talking pixels in the single digits here with a captha that doesn't even take up like 1/3rd of the launcher.",182,2020-09-03 05:58:37,106

When a game reaches 72 hours played, they changed hours to ""days played"", so it would just show as ""3d"", and anything past that would be hidden until you reached 4 days. 

[Example](https://i.imgur.com/vJ5mvc7.jpg)

Not only did Epic grant this request, they now show time played down to minutes and seconds for all games!

GTA V Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/,"As you all know, GTA V is this week's free game. Considering the surge of new visitors we're getting because of GTA V, we've decided to make a new Megathread solely for GTA V related issues, queries, and general info. Please post anything GTA V related here.
___

#Issues/queries with solutions

**I already have GTA V installed from a third party source and/or Steam. Do I really have to redownload it again?**

[Check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/fqmn39i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

**Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?**

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

**I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?**

Restart the EGS and use a different network (perhaps your mobile data), it seems this is related to your IP address somehow.

**I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?**

Once you claim, the game is yours forever.

**The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?**

The servers are on heavy load at the moment, so downloads from Epic servers are going to be significantly slower than usual. Just have patience.

**The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?**

[Check this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/).

**I am getting an MD-0011 or similar error when downloading GTA V (or any other title for that matter). What's going on?**

Just have patience. Epic Games [noted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/) and they're apparently working on a fix, so nothing can really be done for the moment.

**I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?**

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

**After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?**

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

#Noted queries

**Downloads for GTA V are reset upon restarting the launcher for some people.** *I advise anyone with limited bandwidth not to download GTA V or any other large-size title untill this is confirmed to be resolved. We'll try to update this as soon as we know anything new.*

**The EGS isn't launching for a lot of people at the moment, giving 504/503/whatever errors.** *[Apparently fixed](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261132043129413632).*

**Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.** *This apparently isn't a bug.*

**The EGS starts up in a random language.** *Should be fixed as it was a remnant from the heavy load on the servers.* 

**Launching GTA V yields a 'Can't Verify Ownership' message.**
___

Please do note that if you're facing issues specific to GTA V and unrelated to the Epic Games Store, you should try asking around GTA 5 specific subreddits or forums such as r/gtaonline or otherwise. I obviously won't stop you from posting here, but it's just something to keep in mind.

If you have any further inquiries, please feel free to comment below, and I will try and compile everything in the Megathread.",182,2020-05-15 07:55:00,114
My account was hacked ( I got it back) But Epic help did everything it could to not help me and never apologized.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cjzr56/my_account_was_hacked_i_got_it_back_but_epic_help/,"So this tale starts Sunday morningish when I'm a little drunk slash not at my computer. I get two notifications from epic that my PSN has been taken down and two set authentication  has been activated. So When i get back to my place, i had epic store logged in on my computer and get a bit of access to my account. To which i change my password and send epic a help email. During the password switch, it now prompts me for a second code sent to the (hackers) phone.  When i hear back i get a long list of things i have to verify. The list was:  


 ‚Ä¢ Your public¬†IP address(es) (IPv4), which you can find by searching ""What is¬†my IP address"" in your internet browser; if you use multiple devices, please include all IP addresses  
‚Ä¢ Date when you created your Epic Games account  
‚Ä¢ Locations (city, state/province) where you made purchases on the account  
‚Ä¢ Original display name for the account  
‚Ä¢ Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the account  
‚Ä¢ Date of your last login  
‚Ä¢ Names of any PlayStation, Switch, Twitch, or Xbox accounts connected to your Epic Games account and the dates when they were connected  
‚Ä¢ The invoice ID or transaction number from your Epic Games purchase  
\--The invoice ID is located at the top of your Epic Games receipt and begins with an ""A,"" followed by eight (8) or nine (9) digits; example: A12345678.  
\--The transaction number can be found in your emailed Xsolla receipt. Please note that the number is a nine-digit string starting with a ‚Äú4‚Äù or ‚Äú5.‚Äù  
   
So i go about answering the questions the best i can but I'm a little drunk and have to work at 6 am. I don't get all the things but enough that they should have been able to verify me or at least notice i been hacked. The next day i get an email that said they can't verify me and i need to redo the list of things. I'm annoyed but cool and respond that i am working a ten hour shift and if he could just freeze my visa or paypal till i get home. Email back said No we cant do that till we verify that its you.   


At this point, Im hot and hung over. Been working in the sun and starting to get paranoid that i had enabled auto pay. So i post that there is no good reason that they couldn't ensure my credit or paypal wasn't being used and that i would be sharing this on facebook or whatever. They email me back saying hey we treat everyone equally and they were going help me out if i could tell them what season of fortnite i started playing (idk), what my display name was (idk) and what the last ip i used was....  


I went home to finally sit down and try to really figure this out as well as call visa and paypal to protect myself. When i try logging onto epic store just for giggles, I notice that two step authentication has an email option (drunk the last time). I use it and get my account back. I notice that i didn't have paypal on auto purchase (thank God). I notice that i have some new friends with Arabic writing in my friends section. When looking around my account i notice that sunday i agreed to a Eula that was in Arabic for Fortnite. Before this everyone of my responses were nice and professional. This one was not but i didn't swear. And i only called them a Dumbie once. I Pointed out that there was a million red flags that my account was hacked. Like suddenly I'm reading a different language and in a different country.  I ask if i could leave a complaint with his department.....  


There response was we can't help you till you verify your account. We won't ""freeze"" payments till you verify your account. We exchanged responses today about 6ish times. Non as mean as yesterday from me but just me trying to explain how upset i am about the whole thing and them just telling me i need to verify my account. 

My whole take away from this is I'm going to delete my account with epic and not use there service. It is insane that they stonewalled me and ignored what i was saying. Its insane that if you emailed them saying you think your account was hacked they wont freeze payments. If they would have just said that no transations can be made on my account while this was sorted out i would have been happy. I'm just a dumb Nova Scotian, sheet metal worker but this shit was too much.  Sorry if this is the wrong forum for this.",184,2019-07-31 11:09:05,115

Liking Epic more and more...,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gqpmn6/liking_epic_more_and_more/,"I find more and more lately I'm enjoying the epic store. Steam used to have big sales but have paled in the last 5+ years and in fact even their biggest sales of the year I rarely buy anything anymore. I play almost exclusively single player games and have no interest in the competitive nature of online gaming meaning that Epics sales actually mean something to me when I can save 40% off a game and apply a 14$ coupon on top of that for a game it's fantastic. The fact is most games we play for a few dozen hours and then never play again unless they really grab us and that makes it hard to justify a lot of game pricing. About two years ago now I said I'll never buy another triple A game at launch, I'll wait for pricing to go down and the fact is in most cases it doesn't go down which means Epics store pricing and deals go a long way towards me getting more games.  


There are definitely some QoL fixes that need to be done both to their storefront and to our libraries but I really am enjoying it. I went from a hardcore steam supporter (I have 800+ games there) and a hater of Epic to somewhere in the middle but more and more Epic is reminding me of the way Steam used to be. Fact is Steam started way worse then Epic did and I think most people have forgotten that as time has gone by. I look forward to seeing where Epic goes and I honestly think in another year or two if they keep up with what they are doing they will overcome Steam.  


Afterall isn't it all about the game anyway?  


So thanks Epic, thanks for giving an older gamer some hope for the future of gaming.",171,2020-05-26 15:44:27,127

[Suggestion] Please show size of games before installing and how much disk space is left,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gtlim1/suggestion_please_show_size_of_games_before/,"I uninstall and reinstall various games as my amount of free time changes based on my work.  


Some indication as to how large the file is before installing would be a very convenient feature.  


It isn't much, but I assume it is an easy thing to add and would add a lot of polish to the feel of  EGS.  


Thank you for your time.",161,2020-05-31 08:48:12,132
"EGS free giveaways turned me into an indie gamer, no looking back. Also Hyper Light Drifter is enthralling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/i7ll1f/egs_free_giveaways_turned_me_into_an_indie_gamer/,"I normally play mostly triple high production open world games(some in VR) but because of the Epic free giveaways, I've really been able to taste the magic and charm of indies.  My husband keeps making fun of me because I built a custom rig to play VR and I'm just hunched over 2D pixel art titles.  Hyper Light Drifter really entranced me.

Does Epic have a profit with Epic Games Store?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ijcblm/does_epic_have_a_profit_with_epic_games_store/,"Players spent $251 Million on Epic Games Store on third-party titles in 2019.

Do they have profit with that? Since they pay for different promotions, exclusives, free games, coupons all of this probably costs a lot no? We know they paid $10 Million for just Control exclusivity and games like Metro Exodus and Borderlands 3 probably cost a lot more due to them having bigger developers and publishers + those two franchises are way bigger than Control.

This question sparked up in my mind when I saw a post that Fall Guys made Valve more revenue in 25 days not even counting in-app purchases than 130 Epic Games Store games made Epic in 1 year, is that even possible?

It does seem plausible since Fall Guys sold like 7 million copies on Steam in like 25 days, but it's still pretty strange.

Who knows how much they spend on the free games, the vault event probably cost them a shit ton, Civ 6, Borderlands Handsome Collection, GTA V, ARK: Survival Evolved all for free in a month time, they probably gave just Rockstar millions to have GTA V free for 1 week on their store.

Is any information on EGS's profits known, and is there any proof/theories that somebody/some company is ""secretly"" funding any of this? I'd guess obviously not, but it does seem weird that Epic spends so much on free games & exclusives to get little in return? I know, because of free games, their monthly active users get inflated to attract publishers, so there's that, but exclusives almost always get them a large amount of hate, I'd guess exclusives are to force consumers into buying games on their store, but then there are tons of people who just wait for the game to come out of the exclusivity period and release on other platforms, eg. Steam.

I'm very sorry I don't understand this, but I always feel like Epic is shooting themselves in the foot every time they announce an exclusive deal, they get tons of hate, probably pay a shit ton of money to make the game exclusive, and then at the end, it still sells well on Steam and other platforms.",141,2020-08-31 01:01:29,149

Epic Games Store database website EpicData.info is now reworked with new look and additional features,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hp7fbr/epic_games_store_database_website_epicdatainfo_is/,"[EpicData.info](https://EpicData.info) is a database website of Epic Games Store similar to SteamDB for Steam. Recently updated with some useful features so I thought it would be good to share it here in case someone interested for such database tool. Simply this is the website were people get to know what's the next free games during EGS Holiday Sale's 12 days of free games promotion last year. So if a studio going to add its game to the store then it's the first place that will be appear before it went to the live store.

Recently it got price history tracking feature and now it has [Promotional](https://epicdata.info/promotions) tab which lets you to check what games are currently on sale in entire Epic Store catalog. As you may know Epic Store currently doesn't has any filter or section to let you check discounted games all in one place so that would be useful alternative until Epic implement similar filtering feature or 'On Sale' section.

If you want to check the price history for a certain game;

\> Click on New Games tab,

\> Type name of the game you want on search bar at right top corner,

\> Click on the game row, try to avoid clicking on any highlighted hyperlinks on the row,

\> Scroll down on the newly opened page until you see Price History graph,

\> US Dollar is default, if you looking for certain currency other than US Dollar then first click on USD tag then select the tag of what currency you're looking for.

\> If the game you're looking doesn't have price history then it might be hard to notice the base price at first glance. There should be a circular dot sitting on the side of 'value'. Hover over that dot to see the price along with date stamp.

**Ps:** Price history feature is recently implemented to the website frontend so unfortunately you can not see price changes for a game on latest Mega Sale for example. But since it's fetching all price data from now on it will be more useful in time.

**Tip:** You can change the currency on promotional tab as well. US Dollar is set to default but you can change it by clicking on the dropdown menu where it says 'US' right under EpicData button on top left corner. 

**Personal note:** Keep in mind it's not yet feature rich as SteamDB since Epic Store is also lacks on plenty of features and such database can only read what's available on store database to fetch. It can't offer something that if Epic intentionally restrict or it's not available in the first place. Hope this post will help out for other database enthusiasts.",143,2020-07-11 21:48:01,152

How to Run Watch_Dogs after installing from Epic Game Launcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fm1j6d/how_to_run_watch_dogs_after_installing_from_epic/,"I and what seems to be many others have run into the issue where the game will not load after you've downloaded it from the Epic Game Launcher. The game apparently needs to be ran through ubisoft's launcher. Luckily, it appears that everything's been downloaded all you have to do is run the game manually to prompt the ubi launcher to install (small download relative to the game itself)

&#x200B;

1. After you purchase the game from the epic store, click install
2. Choose your install location and install the game (i.e. /c/somepath/epic)
3. Launch your game
4. Link your account from the epic launcher (This either happens after you purchase the game immediately, after your install the game, or right when you first click play, just go through each of these and you'll be asked to link the accounts eventually)
5. Find where your game was installed (/c/somepath/epic/watchdogs)
6. Rename the watchdogs folder to Watch\_Dogs
7. go into Watch\_Dogs/bin and run Watch\_Dogs.exe
8. Ubisoft will load, prompting you to log in
9. Ubisoft will ask you to choose your location to install
10. Select /c/somepath/epic (it automatically appends /Watch\_Dogs because dumbness)
11. If you've done it correctly, it should say ""discovering files"" instead of ""downloading""

Some of you may have problems with linking your account, here's a common FAQ on ubisoft in case people are having weird problems:  [https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000041756](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000041756)",136,2020-03-21 08:55:02,157

So i was skeptical of all the complaints and was enjoying my games on the Epic store, until i pre-purchased Tetris Effect which was supposed to come with an extra DLC (wallpapers and music), the day came and i downloaded Tetris and it was awesome, but there was no DLC... so i contact support and they have the balls to tell me 3 days later they didnt know what the problem was and that i should contact the game developer, despite my surprise at this answer i go ahead and write Tetris support and they tell me its an Epic Store issue, so i contact support again and guess what? they tell me 2 days later they dont know about it, wow! just wow! i go ahead an ask for a refund on Tetris Effect, 3 days later the ticket is closed with no answer, and an email immediately after they ask me to rate the service, serisouly??? i go ahead and make another ticket for a refund, 2 day later the ticket is closed and a rate service email arrives, come on now... i went to the Epic Store website and asked for a refund on every game i have ever purchased (more than $100), 4 day later someone contacted me asking me why i was processing all the refunds, told her i was deleting my account, and so i did, my money was refunded successfully and i no longer plan on open an account with Epic ever again! i dont care about their free games or exclusives, Steam support has replied and fixed my problems in one day, there is no reason for a support team to be this useless.

My compromised account tale!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hmvfxm/my_compromised_account_tale/,"Well, hey everyone!
I'll let you know my tale about my account which was compromised, to let you know, it was so frustrating!
One day, i've logged into my account but password was wrong, i had to fix this immediately. Well, so i've pressed forgot password, and waited for an e-mail, but there was no e-mail arriving from Epic Games about password reset instructions, also i've noticed an e-mail about e-mail change. And as i didn't know about Epic Games Support and their possible account recovery, i started all over!
I've deleted all the previous e-mails from Epic Games(purchase receipts, verification codes and linking), then it was like 1 year later, i contacted Epic Games Support, with almost all requiered details to provide! So, i could provide them account creation date, IP address, previous external accounts(i had only PSN connected before), original display name, location where purchases were made, last 4 digits of the first payment card! As i've provided almost everything except of any purchase recepit or InVoice ID, because i've deleted them a way before, they said that they are not able to verify my ownership. Then i've responded that if it isn't enough to verify my ownership and they said that without the very first payment/purchase receipt, they will not be able to verify my account's ownership. That was so frustrating, but i remembered that my very first purchases were all made on PlayStation, so they must be on my PSN account! I've asked if it would be okey(it had to be, because it was the original proof) and i've provided them the screenshot of the PSN order receipt from PSN portal.

Where does parental accountability begin and end?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ir433x/where_does_parental_accountability_begin_and_end/,"So Epic is being sued in California due to kids spending so much money on Fortnite without the parents consent.

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-09-11/fortnite-children-purchases-refund

Fortnite had parental controls to prevent purchases.  Devices, including PCs, have parental controls to prevent purchases and/or prevent installing of any software without parent consent.

For example, my son literally cannot install anything on the PC or on any of his devices without my consent, none of things will allow him to do it.  He is also playing Diabotical, which has in app purchases, but his EGS account has parental controls on it, and he can't even buy anything on the game without me giving permission for it through typing the 6 digit code first, plus there is no payment information attached to the account anyways.

So where does parental accountability begin and end?  Should all these dev/pubs, whether it is Epic, Valve, EA, ect, be required to give refunds when ever a parent claims their kid bought it without permission?  I can see how that would be abused by people to get refunds after they changed their mind and they'll just claim their kid did it, even if the person doesn't have a child.

"Epic, can you please let users first download and only then install games?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/iip0xa/epic_can_you_please_let_users_first_download_and/,"**updated**:  I stand corrected, Steam client applies the same method (installing while downloading) as Epic Lunacher, but apparently in a much more efficient way. Sorry for the mistaken assumption of mine and let's hope Epic improves its client and network (i.e. more parallelization, better servers, feature to pause downloads and resume them in the next OS session). Bottom line is: It's not acceptable to have to wait for more than 4x the time a Steam user has to wait before being able to play a game.

**original**: *Merging the two parts -- aptly called ""downstalling"" -- significantly increases the time users have to spend sitting in front of their screen before being able to play the game. Steam app, which uses the classic method of keeping the two processes separate, is much more efficient on my config (SSD + high bandwidth): a 36GBs game would be ready to play within 20 minutes on Steam (15 minutes download + 5 minutes installation) while it takes more than 1h30 hour with Epic Launcher.*

How to symlink steam installations of games to the epic store version so you dont have to download twice - quick guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hdg114/how_to_symlink_steam_installations_of_games_to/,"**what is a symlink?** 

symlink stands for symbolic link. basically another name for the same file

**why do i want symlinks?**

if you have two installations of a game (say you had trouble joining your friend's game from his epic installation on your steam installation of a free game from epic, so you got the epic version too) and you dont want to use twice the disk space for the same game, a symlink will allow you to only have one copy of the files but use both installations - saving you data from the download and disk space from the lack of duplicate files

**how do i make symlinks?**

the bold is the commands you use, but with my folders, using ark as an example.  you'll do the same thing but with your folder names. Start the epic installation of the game, pause it, then exit epic games. take note of the folder name that epic created to install, then rename it to anything. open a command prompt as administrator.

type the name of the drive your games are installed on, if its not C:

**D:**

change directories to the folder you renamed at the beginning

**cd D:\\Epic Games\\ARKSurvivalEvolvedrenamed**(whatever you renamed it to)

change directories to the parent folder of the one you installed

**cd ..**

make the symlink, using mklink /j \*original name of the folder epic created\* ""\*path to the steam installation of the game\*""

**mklink /J ArkSurvivalEvolved ""D:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\ARK""**

And thats it! then just open epic games and resume installation and it will verify the existing files from your steam installation instead of downloading them again.

Edit: you may have to rename the exe too to get the epic version",105,2020-06-22 10:32:29,208

EGS used to stand out from the crowd by not using any round corners in their UI, but thats no longer the case as every corner in the store UI is now rounded.

Its a bit inconsistent though, for example game posters in the store have rounded corners, but in the launcher library they're not.

[Temp. Fix] EGS Games are all Vanishing,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/if6fj4/temp_fix_egs_games_are_all_vanishing/,"Yup. Happening to me too, just formatted and reinstalled Windows and my EGS shows no games.

Possible cause: Newest EGS update asked to install on my laptop, I had all my games, as soon as I updated they are all gone. So something is likely fucky on their side when it comes to updating games database.

Temporary fix:

1. Before you open your EGS make a backup of /%localappdata%/EpicGamesLauncher.
2. Open EGS, let it update or whatever it has to do
3. Close EGS
4. Paste the backup back
5. Open EGS again and library should be there
6. Disconnect EGS from the internet. No really. Check Edit 2.

This way I got my games temporarily back, but not all. My backup was old since I don't often check the EGS on my laptop, but they are there. Until Epic gets their shit together, this may help some of you hopefully-

Whatever you got **after** the backup won't show up. At least until this is fixed.

Edit: Edited for clarity.

Edit2: It seems after a while, if the EGS tries to update your games, they will vanish anyway. So my advice is find a way to cut EGS from accessing the internet completely. Nothing a good firewall block won't solve.

Edit3: Games are back, hopefully this will start happening for everyone. I'd mark this as solved but reddit took away the ability to rename threads.",101,2020-08-24 04:44:06,215

#FAQs

##Moving Steam files to EGS

[Follow this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0eob/copying_gta_v_steam_files_to_epic_games_verison/) by /u/Sk_Alooshy

##Moving Steam files without copying

[Follow this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/) bu /u/xevangz

##Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

##I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?

[@EpicGames- ""If you receive this error, please wait 24 hours. You should then be able to proceed with downloading the game.""](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261297169925115905?s=20)

##I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?

Once claimed it is free to keep forever

##Where are my $1,000,000?

It will take Rockstar 7-10 days to credit the amount to your account. This has been already announced by [a banner in their store page](https://i.imgur.com/ViqCwp1.png).

##Can I use my existing RGSC account to claim the rewards?

Yes you can. But we don't know if it makes EGS login mandatory or not for your future sessions.

##The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?

Potato servers

##The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?

[Link to the solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/)

##I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

##After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

##Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.

This is not a bug. Rockstar has made this game unavailable in some regions. You can always work around it using other methods.

## Ownership error Code- 152

We are assuming the authentication servers are overloaded as hell. Give it a day or two. *Some users have been able to bypass it using VPN but the risk is upon you.*

*or* [this solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gkqy0h/gta_v_faq_and_tech_support_megathread_part_2/fqwo7kt/?context=3)

>'Weird Solution' for Ownership Error 152 This error is not shown when i connect my PC using Mobile Data tethering. But when i connect using my Broadband i get this error again!! I do think it's related to some some blocked port in network that's why some people are able to bypass that using VPN.

## GTA V won't let me play in single-player mode. What should I do now?

We're not exactly sure ourselves what the solution is, but we've heard reports that disconnecting your internet until you're able to enter the single-player campaing might work.

Epic isn‚Äôt going ‚Äúbankrupt‚Äù,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gn4t53/epic_isnt_going_bankrupt/,"I‚Äôd like to quash what is a popular argument against using the Epic Game Store in any meaningful way.  Just today someone seriously believed that Epic will be going out of business once the free games stop coming and Fortnite becomes just another game.  

I immediately dismissed this as we all know from stats that Epic themselves have released that user growth on the store is good and the company has recently been valued at ~$15 billion dollars. Later on I got to thinking how much money does Epic as a company really make beyond Fortnite and Epic Store sales.  

So I took a recently released unreal engine game on PlayStation (Final Fantasy remake) and found it‚Äôs sold over 3 million copies in its first three days of release.  So just taking 60$x3 million sales x 5% cut for use of Unreal Engine = $7 million in revenue for Epic in THREE DAYS.  Now consider every other UE game that‚Äôs sold well in just the past six months alone and it becomes clear. 

People have severely underestimated the money Epic is taking in from its game engine alone and with UE5 and next gen consoles it‚Äôs only going to continue.  So buckle in because Epic isn‚Äôt going anywhere and they have the cash flow to keep both timed exclusives and free games coming for users.",87,2020-05-20 16:40:39,239

You may wanna go ahead and delete the appdata entry for Epic  as well as a secondary measure.  (hit windows + r and type in %localappdata%)

As it's been noted the manifest files that mess up the launch as for how to get them back...

To get your games to show as installed...

Ok update to this update.  Drag the epic folder from program files(the one that has the games) to your desktop.   Start a download of the game you need to install.   download ten megs...  close it out.  Drop the game from your desktop folder into the epic folder, overrwrite.... it'll verify your folders.... boom saves you some download time.

Journey to the Savage Planet,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gq7qf6/journey_to_the_savage_planet/,"I‚Äôd been eyeing this game since a few weeks before it came out but never had the available funds to actually buy it.  The $10 coupon and sale together dropped the price to $8 and so I finally grabbed it - this is easily the best $8 I‚Äôve spent in DECADES.

This game is colorful, wicked funny, has a ton of heart, isn‚Äôt crazy-hard like a lot of recent games want to be, is mostly family-friendly (there‚Äôs a couple vaguely inappropriate ‚Äúadvertisements‚Äù on the weird-ass TV in the ship), and actually makes you think about the gameplay instead of mindlessly killing hordes of generic bad guys.

I initially thought it was going to be a survival/builder like Subnautica, but it‚Äôs actually a modern full-3D metroidvania (think Metroid Prime or Arkham Asylum), just without any humanoid enemies.  Explore, scan the plants and animals, get new skills, go back to old areas and use the new skills to get to hidden/locked areas, and explore some more.

Overall, this one gets a 9/10 out of me - I just wish it were longer (although I‚Äôm not done yet, so there might be a twist that extends it, or an NG+ type feature.  I‚Äôm bigtime hoping for DLC or sequels.  :-)",71,2020-05-25 21:06:48,286

This is all due to attempting to make my FIRST purchase on the store and i entered in the wrong expiration. 

They locked my account and repeatedly asked me to show a bank statement verifying i made that purchase, but since the expiration date was wrong there was no purchase to show! 

So i guess beware, if you try to give Epic money instead of accepting free games and enter anything wrong you don't get a second try.

I wrote an opinion piece on the Epic Games Store and why the nature of digital ownership may be the reason some are apprehensive to use it,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hgavmt/i_wrote_an_opinion_piece_on_the_epic_games_store/,"Ever since Epic Games launched their very own storefront at the end of 2018 there has been a vocal opposition within the gaming community. A multitude of different justifications have been put forward for this ‚Äì the fact that the store does not offer user reviews, the aggressive poaching of new releases for Epic exclusivity, and sought after features that consumers had become accustomed to not being present at launch, to name but a few ‚Äì however, what has fascinated me has been the sheer intensity of the voices that object to its presence. It does not strike me as a problem that is merely down to a preference for Steam as a storefront, but instead points at perhaps a more emotive issue for gamers.

The problem with the Epic Games Store, I believe, is not anything inherently wrong with the Epic Games Store itself but instead arises as a result of the uncertainty that is present with digital ownership. From a legal standpoint, purchasing a game digitally in most countries does not give someone ownership of the game itself but, instead, offers them the right to access the licence of said game. This is a somewhat troubling position for those who have invested a significant amount of money and time into building a library of games on a single storefront. Steam has long been the go-to storefront ‚Äì for many, the only storefront ‚Äì for those wishing to purchase games and arguably the Epic Games Store is the first substantial threat to Steam‚Äôs utter dominance within the market.

Quite rightly, there are those that may be apprehensive about the idea of there being a viable competitor on the market, as that competition brings along with it risk. What if the Epic Games Store were to surpass Steam in the near to distant future? What if, god forbid, Steam were ever faced with financial difficulty or made a conscious decision to go in a different direction as a business? There is no definitive answer to the question of what would happen to their purchases should this happen. Consumers within the video game industry are arguably best positioned to be aware that digital ownership is, at present, a mere illusion of ownership. Whilst those who purchase albums, books or films digitally may not fully appreciate the frailty of their access to their digital goods many gamers have faced the brunt of licencing issues (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World), disputes that have occurred internally within a company (P.T), and even political issues (Devotion) playing a role in a game becoming inaccessible.

Ultimately, however, competition inevitably benefits the consumer in the long run. The Epic Games Store being a viable alternative to Steam places pressure on Steam to adapt, improvise and improve their service for both consumers and developers. You do not need to look very far to see some of the benefits that have arisen since the Epic Games Stores launch. Over $2,000+ of free games have been offered to consumers as of May 2020 and developers have taken home more of the profits generated from their game as the percentage taken by Epic‚Äôs storefront is magnitudes smaller than the cut taken by Steam (12 percent as opposed to 30 percent). The complacency that Steam has often faced criticism for in the past is no longer an option. They must fight for their position in the market and, even for those willing to die on Steam‚Äôs hill, that is a good thing as it fosters innovation.

Whilst this is an issue that has been particularly prevalent on PC it is not one that is exclusive to the platform. With Xbox releasing an all-digital version of the Xbox One S in 2019 and the Playstation 5 reveal showcasing that there will be a digital only offering on launch the consumers position in regards to digital ownership is only going to become more important. Subscription services such as Game Pass and PS Now may render this issue irrelevant by the end of the decade. It is not hard to see the influence that subscription services such as Spotify and Netflix has had on ownership, both physical and digital, in their respective mediums ‚Äì however, for the time being, the uncertainty that digital ownership brings is an issue that deserves more attention ‚Äì and I believe that, at least to some degree, the aversion to the Epic Games Store has been somewhat influenced by this problem.",71,2020-06-27 04:32:41,294

Add the ability to see what games someone else has,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ifmbo3/add_the_ability_to_see_what_games_someone_else_has/,"Maybe also the option to go private and not let anyone else see.

This would both be a nice social feature (and epic games even has the ability to add people as a friend *through* epic, as seen in Fortnite).

Also, this would massively help people like me who buy games on multiple platforms and have to use a game collection tracker like [rawg.io](https://rawg.io)

Thanks You Epic for giving free game since launch until now.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gs9qor/thanks_you_epic_for_giving_free_game_since_launch/,"Since Pretty much felt hard time in this situation, I got owned almost 90+ game entire epic library claim including a lot I brought owned even when sometime sale like winter sale on steam,from GOG giving free 10 or 12 game,Uplay And so much more had pretty much sometime with annoying different launcher with total 300+ game I ever find to play. But,its not hard sometime enjoy game because of launcher or something. That's why pretty much Use Both Steam and even Epic to find backlog library game i ever play or even using GOG Galaxy to sync all different launcher to find ever game owned since hardtime this current situation.

And if you want find where to keep free game and any deals,i recommended go r/gamedeals for best see free to claim game and discount

Hopefully this my thought after I finally find game even I not owned game yet

Using Steam GTA Files for Epic Games GTA V without copying,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/,"I want to be able to play GTA Online separately from my brothers account who is linked with steam, but don't wanna have two 90GB folders for the same game as that's just wasting space.

1. Install GTA V and when it prompts for a location, put in a directory you'll remember (for this example C:\\GTAV)
2. Let it install for a little bit then cancel (GTA V installation should say resume in your library) and close Epic Games completely
3. Go to GTA V install folder (C:\\GTAV for this tutorial or wherever you saved it) and make sure a folder named .egstore is there
4. Copy and paste the .egstore folder to your Steam GTA V location (usually found in C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V)
5. Delete your Epic Games GTA V folder
6. Open up a Command Prompt. Can be easily found right clicking the Windows logo or typing cmd in search bar
7. Type in `mklink /D ""your epic games folder location"" ""your steam location""`  eg. `mklink /D ""C:\GTAV"" ""C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Grand Theft Auto V""`. You know you did it right if it creates a folder with a shortcut icon 
8. Launch Epic Games Launcher and you should be able to resume and verify the GTA V installation instead of downloading anything
9. Once everything is verified and installed you should be able to launch GTA V with no problems and 90GB less space taken on your drive

What this does is creates a different type of folder shortcut where the Epic Games Launcher doesn't know its being directed to shortcut and thinks its a normal folder. But why do this instead of just pointing the install location to the steam folder? The launcher requires an empty folder for installation.

Both Steam and Epic Games launch perfectly but it requires a verification of the files each time you switch platforms as it will ask for activation on steam or refuse to even launch on epic if you don't verify. I recommend not doing this if you have a mechanical drive and have no patience as verifying game files can take long but if you got an SSD go for it! 

For now this method seems to work but I have no idea how this will act when the game updates. I theorize that it shouldn't impact anything as the game folders themselves have the same structure but time will tell.

Random ending here but are you guys having trouble with controllers on Epic Games GTA V? Can't stand driving with WASD and all these binds are kind of confusing for me. Also this is my first shot at a tutorial post of any kind so it might be kind of wack but I'm just out tryna help out the people.",69,2020-05-15 23:51:50,298

Epic Games and Linux.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gbx1vz/epic_games_and_linux/,"Dear Epic Games, I know, your history with Linux is kinda mixed. While Unreal Tournament and Unreal Engine natively support Linux (You can compile them), Epic Games Launcher still lacks a Linux client. A lot of the games in Epic Games Store natively support Linux on other platforms such as Steam or GoG. I think Epic Games should release a Linux client, or at least give us some news about it. Epic Games working natively would be a huge step for gaming on Linux. Maybe even with a Wine solution or Proton. (Latter would probably require agreements with Valve.)

Easy Anti-Cheat.Probably one of the biggest problem for gaming on Linux is anti-cheat software alongside media foundation. (Which has workarounds. I think Wine was working for it at some point.) EAC actually has a native Linux version, but it lacks support for Wine/Proton. EAC supporting Wine would mean a lot of games working through compatibility layers.

I hope for a more Linux positive future for Epic Games. Have a great day and stay safe, people.",67,2020-05-02 13:38:23,300

Why doesn't Epic make their store better?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/eki5pt/why_doesnt_epic_make_their_store_better/,"I just don't get it. I really, really love what the Epic Games Store is doing, and I have so many great games because of them either being free or a lot cheaper. But, I just don't get why they don't improve their store.

For example, my little brother wanted Subnautica: Below Zero. It was half the price on Epic as it is on Steam, so I wanted to get it there. But, somehow, Epic doesn't have product gifting? that's just so weird to me, and I had to physically go to his computer and buy it for him, which is not an option for most gifting.

If Epic fixes their store, it would easily nullify a lot of people's problems with it. They'd still find something to hatejerk about, but it would be something!

Things they need to fix/add (feel free to add more):

- Game gifting

- Shopping cart

- Wish list

- Game reviews

- Reduce the processing power/internet/memory that the launcher uses (not a problem for all users, but my friend cites this as one reason he doesn't like it)

- Mods (not sure if this is possible)

- Better support for other countries, in the form of local currency and fee waiving (some countries, like those in Eastern Europe, have extra fees on Epic that they don't have on Steam)

- Customer support is iffy sometimes

- Achievements (seems to be highly requested)

I really wish Epic could succeed more, because Steam definitely isn't a perfect platform either. I just don't get why they don't even seem to be trying to improve the storefront.",65,2020-01-06 08:59:46,307

Please add an option to open the Epic Games Launcher in the library and other annoyances I want Epic to fix,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/if143y/please_add_an_option_to_open_the_epic_games/,"It's for the sake of convenience. Both Steam and GOG Galaxy let's you start their platforms in the library when you open them up.

And while I have peoples attention, having to ""load up"" the launcher every time I click on the icon in the system tray despite being logged in is really annoying. Both Steam and GOG doesn't ""load"" into the library when I click their icons in the system tray after already being logged, they quickly pop into the library.

This might sound ""small"", but GOG and especially Steam has made multiple ""smaller"" things to the PC gaming experience making it more convenient to play games. Having to load into the library despite being logged in and having to switch to the library after having logged in is making me want to use the Epic Games Launcher less.

The reason Im not using GOG Galaxy with EGS is because it takes some time to get the games synced up everytime I start up Galaxy and the playtime is lagging behind on EGS (ex. Maneater showing 22m on Galaxy while showing 28m on EGS, it's really annoying, almost like Galaxy doesn't manage to track it).",62,2020-08-23 22:42:35,320

Why Epic's Giveaway Titles are Perfect,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gnzoer/why_epics_giveaway_titles_are_perfect/,"first of all for those who say that civ 6 is disappointing, let me remind you that you were going to be disappointed either way because nothing can top the most profitable piece of entertainment in history

remember that by just giving away insane games epic can't guarantee sales, every free game they give has to give them results. if epic gave out witcher 3, red dead 2..etc all in the same sale it wouldn't help them that much because its gonna be the same people that get them.

wouldn't be better to diversify and bring in completely new and different types of players to their store, and that is exactly what's happening here: the best selling AAA title ever,civ 6 the most played strategy game in the world, borderlands the biggest looter-shooter franchise in the world, ark one of the most played survival games in the world...it just makes sense

now all of this doesn't mean that games like witcher or red dead will never go free on epic, it just means that epic aren't throwing their best cards at the same time ( which is never a good idea ).

You might also argue that then they shouldn't have started it with a game that is so big and set expectations so high. i would argue that if you want the biggest possible attraction to your sale then what better way than giving literally the most wanted game worldwide. because once you come to the store you're gonna immediately get caught by the insanely low prices on other games( like the witcher 3)

plus i feel like people are getting a bit spoiled by epic. we got so attached to these free games that we started to put expectations and getting disappointed forgetting that THIS IS NOT A STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY

in conclusion, while you might never play civ 6 or ark or borderlands,but believe me a lot of people will and epic are about to get flooded with demand

plus just a side note: how the hell were epic supposed to surpass giving out the biggest AAA game in the world",59,2020-05-22 04:09:22,335

Borderlands 3 download reset to ZERO after 12 hours of preload!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d3j6fw/borderlands_3_download_reset_to_zero_after_12/,"Just to let you guys know, I haven't use reddit since like long time ago, but I have to post here to show how god awful my experience with the game launcher.

&#x200B;

I ONLY need it to do one thing. Let me download my games, & then let me play.

&#x200B;

My internet bandwidth is slow & I typically need 12 hours or so to download a 25GB game, & expect B3 to be at least a day.

&#x200B;

I preload the game after paying yesterday, & after 12 hours or so, reached like 30%. I said cool, maybe I can finally play after work on Friday. Due to reasons, I have to restarted the launcher & downloAd reset to ZER0! ZERO! Apparently also, the download changed from originally 55.8GB to 56.5GB, presuming due to the game already release, & its a different  Download?

&#x200B;

Either way, its awful. I only downlaod from Epic becuase its not on steam. I WILL NEVER get a game from Epic again if it is also available on steam, if this is the experience I get. I also have control, & I couldn't download for 6 hours after paying. Only worked after that (for whatever reason).

Did I mentioned also the download speed is god awful.

&#x200B;

If it reset to zero again, I am refunding the game, & that will be my last purchase on the store.",60,2019-09-13 15:18:23,341

I've already noted some of the posts about Self-Refunds (you guys are quick). Quite a few more  features have also released.

Edited to include the full post.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey Folks,

We're fast approaching the second half of 2020 and more feature-complete development work is live on the Epic Games Store. You'll find some of the recently shipped features and what's coming up next.

Missed out on the previous Dev Updates?

* [Wishlists](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/wishlists-are-here)
* [Previous Developer Update](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/egs-end-of-year-dev-update)

NEW FEATURES

**Self-Service Refunds**

We've recently enabled the ability to self-refund qualifying purchases online by yourself. When you sign into your account on the Epic Games website, click the ""Account"" dropdown in the top right corner of the webpage, go to the ""Transactions"" tab and click the game title. If the game is eligible for a self-service refund, please click the ""Refund"" option to initiate the refund process.

>All games are eligible for a refund within 14 days of purchase for any reason. However, you must not have played more than 2 hours.  
>  
>You will not be eligible for games from which you have been banned or for which you have otherwise violated the terms of service. In addition, you may not be eligible for refunds if Epic determines that you are abusing the refund policy.

*How will I receive my refund?*

Once a purchase has been selected for refund, it will be refunded to the payment method used to make the purchase, however, this may not always be possible depending on the payment method. Also, note that the amount of time for a refund to process is dependent on your payment method. You can read more on the Epic Games Store Refund policy [here](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/store-refund-policy).

**Changes to Ownership Authorization**

As part of our Self-Service Refunds initiative and to better support offline play, we are making changes to the way Epic Games Launcher checks the ownership of installed games.

This now occurs earlier in the launch process so players are informed if their account does not own an installed title that is being launched. If ownership does not pass this authorization check Error Code: LS-0021 will display the following:This account does not have ownership of \[game title\]. If you wish to play this game, please purchase it in the store or log in with an account that does have ownership.Special consideration was taken to try and provide an uninterrupted experience in cases of network instability or outages. For those instances, the Epic Games Store client keeps memory of owned titles, which it will automatically keep updated whenever players are online and signed-in. If for whatever reason it cannot reach our services, it will still allow the launch of the titles in this memory.If you encounter Error Code: LS-0021, you can review this article for assistance:¬†[https://epic.gm/ls-002](https://epic.gm/ls-0021)

**Keyless Integration**

Today we announced partnerships with third-party digital sales platforms; Fanatical, Green Man Gaming, and Genba Digital to offer keyless purchases for Epic Games Store titles. These partnerships make it easier for players to purchse games from third-party sites, by allowing them to link their Epic Games Store accounts to their retailer of choice.

Players will no longer need to take additional steps to redeem a key which often includes exchanging 20-digit redemption codes. Instead, this provides more confidence knowing a purchase is coming from a legitimate source and that it is directly attributed to your linked Epic Games account.

**Bandwidth Management**

We recently released the first iteration of bandwidth management tools for players looking to have more control over their download options. The tool recently shipped enables bandwidth limitations or ""throttling"" for players that have limited bandwidth availability and would like to perform installs and updates over a longer period of time.

This feature can be enabled in your ""Settings"" on the Epic Games Launcher.

**More Local Currencies**

The Epic Games Store recently introduced support for five more currencies:

* CAD
* AUD
* SEK
* DKK
* NOK

The currencies supported continue to be updated, so be on the lookout for any new changes in the future.

Development In Progress

**Mod Support for Games**

Players will soon be able to browse a catalog of player and developer made mods for their games. Players will be able to auto-install mods into games they own, that are managed by the Epic Games launcher or download the files separately for other games.

**Achievements**

The Achievement service for titles on the Store is currently in development. We look forward to sharing more information about the system soon.

Please allow us to safely change installation folder and not have to go complicated cmd stuff and which may not even work and corrupt save files,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/h04bdt/please_allow_us_to_safely_change_installation/,"This is the possible way to change installation folder which is just too hard in my opinion. The reason why I want to change installation folder is that I bought new hard disk where I would like to move stuff now cause it has space.  


"" *Originally posted by* ***superboep*** [*View Post*](https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/forums/unreal-tournament-discussion/ut-game-general-discussion/6527-how-do-i-change-the-install-location?p=404143#post404143)*Try using symbolic links for a workaround, using* ***Junction****. I use this for lots of stuff because my I don't want my SSD drives bogged with things like email database files. Proceed with caution:*

1. *Make sure all Epic Games and the Launcher are not running.*
2. *Check Windows Task Manager and kill any Epic processes as well - e.g.* *EpicGamesLauncher.exe*
3. *Find the install location, the default Epic Root seems to be* *C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games*
4. *Move the folder to the drive you want it in - e.g.* ***D:****\\Program Files\\Epic Games*
5. *If you don't have the Junction tool installed - you can get it from* [*here*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/junction)*. Put it in a folder that the windows PATH can find.*
6. *Go to the command line (CMD seems better than PowerShell in this case) and change directory to the original folder root (e.g.* *C:\\Program Files)*
7. *Create a symlink, e.g. run* *junction ""Epic Games"" ""D:\\Program Files\\Epic Games"".* *This will create a new ""folder""called* *Epic Games* *which points to the D: drive. If you look at it in Windows Explorer there will be a little shortcut arrow on the folder showing it points somewhere else.*
8. *Test that the symlink is working...*
   1. *DIR ""Epic Games"". It should show you the files you moved to the new drive*
   2. *OR just browse it in Explorer - it should feel as though nothing has changed.*
   3. *The main difference is that if you browse your d: drive you'll see the folder is* *actually* *here.*
9. *Run Epic. To the game launcher nothing should have changed.*
10. *If for any reason you need to delete a junction run* *junction -d ""C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games""*

Just as an update, the cmd shell in Windows 10 includes an internal command called mklink which can also be used for creating symbolic links. So for example, I just moved Borderlands 3 from I:\\games\\Borderlands3 to J:\\games\\Borderlands3 following steps 1-4 here. Then all I needed to do was open cmd as admin, go to I:\\games and run  


Code:  
mklink /D Borderlands3 j:\\games\\Borderlands3  


The dir command in cmd shows this in I:\\games now:  
Code:  
09/11/2019  12:54    <SYMLINKD>     Borderlands3 \[j:\\games\\Borderlands3\]  


Borderlands 3 launches same as before. Somewhat faster since my J drive is an SSD and I drive is not.",55,2020-06-10 17:12:21,351

Fix for games being unplayable due to camera looking up and spinning,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hz5jwa/fix_for_games_being_unplayable_due_to_camera/,"So for the past half year or so I have not been able to play and any of my epic game store games because there was a constant up and to the left input.

For me the issue was that something called vJoy Device in Game Controller settings had a constant Up and it the left input, I have no idea what this Vjoy Device is but here is the fix.  


\- Search ""vjoy"" in the search bar in windows. 

\- Click ""Configure vJoy""

\- Untick all of the axes ""X, Y, Z, RX, etc.""

\-Click apply and restart your PC.

Just Cause 4 Epic Games Version Graphic Settings Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g2urgy/just_cause_4_epic_games_version_graphic_settings/,"I've been doing heavy research and development on the graphic settings of Just Cause 4 for the past couple of hours both in game and from multiple other guides throughout the internet and thought I'd share the best settings that I've came up with for those that want to maximize performance without losing visual fidelity whatsoever.

These settings are my official locked settings.

EDIT April 17th: Here are 3 quick videos I created showing the difference of performance between ultra and my custom graphics settings below...

[Just Cause 4 Graphics Settings Comparison 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52c6e3cC8I)

[Just Cause 4 Graphics Settings Comparison 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jWUJhZB2KY)

[Just Cause 4 Graphics Settings Comparison 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgH3_wEveP0)

Specs used in the videos:  Windows 10 1440p 144 Hz GSync Monitor GTX 1070 4C/4T 6th Gen i5 @ 3.2 GHz 16GB DDR4 RAM

* Screen Settings: Fullscreen
* Vertical Sync: No
* Anisotropic Level: 16x (max)
* Resolution: Native Resolution, 1440p (143Hz) for me
* Anti-Aliasing: OFF - Around 10 fps drop on SMAA, so go FXAA if you must use AA. I personally don't see much visual difference between the three settings because all the settings present jaggies. So I have it OFF. In 1080p this may look different so this setting is a setting to experiment with. I didn't notice much fps hit with FXAA on, maybe 2-5 fps, if that. Still like it OFF because I'm in 1440p.
* Texture Quality: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Water Detail: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Ocean Tessellation: Yes (turning this off drops 2-3 fps for some reason, leave it on)
* LOD Factor: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Shadow Quality: Very High (max) - Strangely this setting doesn't affect fps much at all, even on low. So a no-brainer to leave it on Very High. If you like less sharp shadows, try High but it's not going to impact fps, just that personal preference of less sharp(soft) shadows. Same at medium. So consider Very High as sharp, High as soft, Medium as softest and Low as garbage.
* SSAO: No - BIGGEST fps hit in the game, just turn it off. There's a couple reasons to turn this on imo. One, if you're a big fan of ambient occlusion in general. Those tiny shadow details on objects that make the game more realistic. And two, if you care more about this tiny detail than you do a good chunk of fps. My guess is around 9-13 fps, give or take. Hardware will differ of course.
* Motion Blur: No (personal preference, 1-2 fps impact with it on)
* Edge Fade: No (personal preference, zero impact on fps)
* Global Illumination: No (3-4 fps impact with it on) The visual difference of this setting may take more time to develop because I noticed no difference visually but in Just Cause 3, I did. Might turn this one on in the future if I find a visual difference. In Just Cause 3, the difference visually was basically sunlight bloom. Or just the heat that the sun causes, if that makes any sense.
* Screen Space Reflections: No (turning this on will drop around 3-5 fps) This is a setting many people may prefer to be ON because it basically puts reflections of mountains and what not in water. I personally want the extra fps boost but may decide to change my mind if I like what I see as I play the game turning it on and off in different areas of the game.
* Bokeh Depth of Field: No (personal preference, 1-2 fps impact with it on)

Side Note (apart from this graphic settings guide): One thing to note is that sometimes when first starting up the game, it seems laggy and presents screen tearing(no clue why but it's happened once for me on like 20 startups in the past hour). Not sure why this happens but I found the fix within a few minutes of tinkering around while it was happening. You simply change the resolution in the in-game settings from your native resolution/(Hz) to something lower, apply the settings. Then change it right back to where you had it. This fixes both the lagginess and screen tearing that sometimes is presented for some reason upon playing the game.

P.S. Hope everyone that isn't able to play the game due to the crashing get to play it asap. The devs are working on fixing the issue and hopefully will relay some info on what's going on with it. I know there's a workaround by just playing the game offline but still.",54,2020-04-17 16:14:00,368

Tech Support Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/,"***DISCLAIMER***

***We are a community run subreddit and have nothing to do with Epic. None of the mods are from Epic, we have no contact with Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else*** [***email their support***](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) ***and let them know.***

Welcome to the fourth Tech Support Megathread.

Before we go further, you can find the previous megathreads below.

[First Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/evmlss/tech_support_megathread/)

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

[Third Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g3brrj/tech_support_megathread/)

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issues which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

*as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision, all tech issues regarding non-recent topics should be posted to this megathread. Use common sense to determine what is recent and what isn't (As a general rule: any current free game or any release in the last two weeks would count as recent). Please post all other tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[**Solutions/Fixes Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing).

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Thanks for your time and patience.

And since there are no preloads on this shit store, i can only download the game the day after the game releases, that means 2 days after the game releases will I actually be able to play the fucking game because of the worlds worst download client...

A warning to all who purchase from EpicGames.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gfqr03/a_warning_to_all_who_purchase_from_epicgames/,"I thought i'd share my experience with EpicGames and their customer support.

I have had an account with Epic games since they started dishing out free games, because why not? Free is good! I have played numerous games online with a couple of close friends, World War Z being the most recent one.

In May last year, using a ¬£10 off voucher, i purchased Satisfactory for ¬£16.99. I then proceeded to play this game with a friend for around 50+ hours during several of their patches over the last 12months.

Fast forward to April this year and i logged on to add the latest free games when i noticed that my library had cut down from around 50ish games (i've claimed every free game) to only 12. This included my only purchased game of Satisfactory, now gone from my library.

I went through their troubleshooting answers which suggested i may have ""hidden"" them in my library or they might be on a different account.

Neither of most common answers resolved my issue so i proceeded to contact Epic Games Support. They responded quickly to state that they have checked my account and there are no missing games on my account and that i must have these ""missing"" games on a different account.

I'd like to think i'm a fairly switched on person but i thought, 'ok, maybe i am being a muppet here'. I tried to log onto epic games on my ONLY other email address and it informed me there was no account linked to that email address. To try and eliminate the possibility that i was in fact being a muppet, i asked my friend to let me know what my name was on his friends list that i played Satisfactory and/or World War Z. My friend responded to me with my name for the account that i was using. This to me, Confirms without doubt that i only have one account. If it was on another account he would have two names for me on his friends list.

Epic Games continued to insinuate that there must be another account and they asked me for a copy of my receipt for any of the missing games.

Easy i thought.... I logged onto my email account and searched for ""Your Epic Games Receipt"" and it brought up a list of about 10 entries. All of which were within the last month. Sadly, they were all in my ""junk"" folder. It turns out my inferior email account ""hotmail"" decided to place and then delete all of these receipts in my junk folder. Turns out, i am a muppet, and should have checked after each purchase!

I accepted partial blame to Epic Games for this but they didn't really care.

I provided them with my bank transaction ID for my purchased of Satisfactory, But they didn't really care.

I explained myself time and time again, but they didnt really care. At this point i questioned why i was even bothering over what was only ¬£17 and a bunch of games i probably wouldnt play anyway.

After several weeks of back and forth emails they still say ""there must be another account"", despite proving to myself, at least, that this is simply not possible.

My only conclusion is that somehow, for whatever reason, my account was wiped and ALL games prior to March 2020 had gone from my account, free & purchased. (With the exception of Fortnite and Unreal Tournament).

I for one will never use EPIC games again and am appalled by their lack of willingness to listen as well as their system for not being able to track my purchase or search for a copy of my receipt on their end, despite giving them the information any large company would need to track a purchase for goods within a 12 month period.

I will give credit to Epic Games Customer service for their quick responses, especially during these trying times. Credit where Credit is due.

Rant over.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR** 

Epic Games wiped my account of all games prior to March 2020, Including purchased and free games.",47,2020-05-08 22:31:27,397
Epic Games Launcher Is Lacking Something BIG!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/euzwfn/epic_games_launcher_is_lacking_something_big/,"Since arriving back at college, I've began using my laptop in conjunction with my portable HDD (for games). Essentially, I've noticed that I need to use a janky workaround in order to force the Epic Games Launcher to use the copy of my game; which I already have installed on my portable HDD (in this case the game is Borderlands 3). If Epic Games were to implement a feature into their launcher which recognizes and makes playable the games one has previously installed, that would be very much appreciated!

In other words, if I were to boot up steam on my laptop and then plug in my USB HDD (in that order). I can go to the settings menu and select my USB HDD, once done, steam would then recognize them as ""installed"" and let me play them immediately. The Epic Games Launcher NEEDS this feature as well.

Thanks!

Edit: I suppose it's worth mentioning that the biggest reason I began using my USB HDD aside from simply storing files and memes. It's more so I can have all my games installed in one spot (i.e. As long as I have my drive I have my games). This is even more true for my stash of emulators/ emulated games which can't simply have their saves stored on the cloud automatically like most steam games and the such.",45,2020-01-28 16:34:54,398

My first experience with the epic games store... its not good.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d5bpog/my_first_experience_with_the_epic_games_store_its/,"I am a PhD student, free time is a valuable resource. I have carved out one night to play some Borderlands 3. 

Honestly when people started boycotts and petitions I thought they were being a little ridiculous, if EA can make a market place work (most of the time) anyone should be able to. But the epic game store is really not ready for a major release like this.

I go to try and purchase BL3 but all of the prices are in US dollars, strange I have only ever added a Canadian address but whatever. Then I go to purchase and I get hit with a please purchase this game from your own countries storefront. Mildly annoying but surely this is an easy fix. After checking through every setting I cant find anything so I turn to the FAQ... You need to contact support to change the country of an account. Alright now I more annoyed at the prospect of sitting in a chat queue for a bit but whatever. Then I see the only support option is email. Are you joking? I can get live support for the fucking burrito I just ordered but if I want to drop 100 dollars on a AAA game I need to wait on an email. What a colossal waste of time. How are you ever going to out compete other marketplaces with no single feature that is an improvement?

So anyway in the two hours I've been waiting for a support response I have had plenty of time to write this rant. And I suppose if the response doesn't come tonight maybe I will just wait for the steam release after all.

Edit: Still no response from support. Going on 15 hours now. Maybe I'll just buy Monster Hunter World on steam.",48,2019-09-17 16:00:25,400

Troubles with the launcher and now my games are gone!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bsdy8z/troubles_with_the_launcher_and_now_my_games_are/,"I've contacted Epic Games support about this, but so far, no answer. Let me elaborate how the thing started

On May 23rd, I noticed some troubles about my Epic Games Launcher. Basically most screens were BLACK and when I clicked on the tabs, nothing happened. The games started so far (I tried with Subnautica), so I thought it was an issue with my internet conection or the launcher itself. I tried to download some of the free games, (Dauntless, Rhyme, or Stories Untold) but to no avail: Where should be the button for getting the game, there was just the word ""Loading"". I re-downloaded the launcher installer, reinstalled it, but nothing happened. The issue remained: I could not access my game library and to get into the store I had to click on the Library, then on ""Shop games and Mods"" (if I do a click on the Store tab, it would do nothing at all) or getting to the store by right - clicking the icon on the Task Bar, near the Network Access and the clock, and then left click on STORE.

Then, on midnight (May 24th), I uninstalled the launcher, using the Control Panel (on Windows 7). JUST THE EPIC GAMES LAUNCHER, nothing else. I proceed to reinstall the launcher again and to my SHOCK, I saw some of the games I got were missing: Subnautica (12-14-2018), SuperMeat Boy (12-28-2018), What remains of Edith Finch (01-12-2019), Oxenfree (03-23-2019) and Transistor (04-19-2019).

I don't know what happened or WHY by uninstalling THE LAUNCHER those games I mentioned were also UNINSTALLED without a warning or nothing. I know, they were free games that EPIC gave us every two weeks, but I really want some kind of explanation here. I really want to have at least SUBNAUTICA back. I've written to Epic Games support and also on twitter. I will post here the links to the tweets I sent them, along with the screen captures revealing the problems.

I hope (and beg) some of you can help me with this issue.

I've tried System Recovery even doing a recovery of May 23rd at 11 a.m. at which point I haven't started the Epic Games Launcher for the day and it didn't do any good. After doing that, the games are still missing. Also I tried to Restore Previous versions of the folders and would not allow me, because according to that, there are no previous versions.

"In some ways, achievements/trophies are more important than even a shopping cart, if Epic want to attract more publishers/developers to its platform, and compete with others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ex6bj6/in_some_ways_achievementstrophies_are_more/,"Although achievements aren't always a priority for PC gamers, they can add a lot more replay value to some games which are usually only played once, then put down forever. This might not always be important to the average game, but adding achievements to a game like ""collect all journals"", or ""play the game on hard, normal & easy"" can be an incredibly simple method of keeping people coming back to your game for that 100% reward. It would be very appealing to many publishers, especially with the 88% cut.

This is very noticeable with PSN trophies, as players have a level they can maintain and a platinum trophy to achieve, after reaching 100%. This makes playing a game for longer, or for multiple playthroughs, a lot more appealing to players who like to get the most out of a game.

I think it would be even better if the platform added profile backgrounds & game profile picture rewards, as an incentive for players to unlock 100% of achievements (after the store adds social features of course).

If achievements are done right, and quickly, then it could give the platform a massive advantage over other PC platforms, due to how simple achievements are on PC currently.",43,2020-02-02 02:45:39,415

Oxygen not included taken off Epic Store?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/emrl9w/oxygen_not_included_taken_off_epic_store/,"Hi, so a while ago i thought about getting ONI, but then, as the Black Friday sale came along, changed my mind and got a few other games. Now i want to buy oxygen not included, but when i go to the Epic Store i cant find it. have they taken it off? because on the Klei website, it only links to steam. But if, in google, i type in ""oxygen not included epic games"" then it gives me a viable link, which leads me to a 404 error.

Does anyone know if this game is going to be back on? because since there is still a link, i assume they are going to put it back on, but . . . maybe not.

I did a bit of digging and it turns out Oxygen not Included was put in the ""naughty box"" a while back for not participating in a sale, but was put back on the Store. is ONI's removal permanent, does anyone know?

thanks in advance for answering

There are some people from Epic who, of their own volition, have become members of the sub.

There are a lot of different types of people talking about the Epic store with some valid and some invalid feelings towards it but that doesn't really matter here. This place is a community of people who, instead of mindlessly complaining, would like to give advice towards making the store better in the long run. We know the store is missing things, we know there are technical bugs, and we know other stores are working fine with features the Epic store doesn't have.

With all that said we choose to dedicate our energy here towards trying to make it better rather than spouting the obvious in obscenity filled rants. A lot of posts here really break the civility rule of the sub. No, if you come here with a curse filled rant post we aren't going to help you or give you attention. You're not ""sticking it"" to anyone, we aren't associated with Epic.

Before posting here ask yourself what you hope to accomplish with your post. Are you looking for advice? Are you trying to give feedback for those few Epic folks floating around? Or are you just looking for a platform to rant on? In the end we are all just people, we aren't paid to be here so make an effort to not treat people like crap. If you're here simply because you hate Epic there's better places for you to go.

#FAQs

##Moving Steam files to EGS

[Follow this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0eob/copying_gta_v_steam_files_to_epic_games_verison/) by /u/Sk_Alooshy

##Moving Steam files without copying

[Follow this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/) bu /u/xevangz

##Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

##I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?

[@EpicGames- ""If you receive this error, please wait 24 hours. You should then be able to proceed with downloading the game.""](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261297169925115905?s=20)

##I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?

Once claimed it is free to keep forever

##Where are my $1,000,000?

It will take Rockstar 7-10 days to credit the amount to your account. This has been already announced by [a banner in their store page](https://i.imgur.com/ViqCwp1.png).

##Can I use my existing RGSC account to claim the rewards?

Yes you can. But we don't know if it makes EGS login mandatory or not for your future sessions.

##The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?

Potato servers

##The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?

[Link to the solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/)

##I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

##After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

##Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.

This is not a bug. Rockstar has made this game unavailable in some regions. You can always work around it using other methods.

## Ownership error Code- 152

We are assuming the authentication servers are overloaded as hell. Give it a day or two. *Some users have been able to bypass it using VPN but the risk is upon you.*

*or* [this solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gkqy0h/gta_v_faq_and_tech_support_megathread_part_2/fqwo7kt/?context=3)

>'Weird Solution' for Ownership Error 152 This error is not shown when i connect my PC using Mobile Data tethering. But when i connect using my Broadband i get this error again!! I do think it's related to some some blocked port in network that's why some people are able to bypass that using VPN.

**New solution**

Switch to Cloudflare DNS- https://1.1.1.1/dns/

Change the ipv4 settings. Details are given there.

An open letter to EGS,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjx3jk/an_open_letter_to_egs/,"The Epic Game Store is at the forefront of becoming a major market player and is quickly becoming the second largest digital PC gaming marketplace for gamers.  This is no doubt not an easy task and continues to face growing pains throughout the months as features continue to be developed and added into the launcher and services continue to improve.  I think Epic however needs to refocus on usability for all users of the service.  It is not a great look when your store is down/unstable for 12+ hours and its even worse when platform instability prevents users from accessing their existing games.  I am fully aware that this crash is rarely if ever avoided on any platform when demand for an item is so high, however that doesn't mean Epic gets a pass on it. I want them to do better and these outages need to be contained far quicker in the future.  I am excited to see Epic already implementing a feature that alleviates the game launching by implementing an upcoming offline state for the launcher when internet connectivity is poor or not available, I hope they integrate it into their service so that if their is an outage the launcher will detect it and simply open in offline mode, rather then displaying an error and random languages (that is not a great customer facing experience) not to mention users having to go through Windows File explorer to launch downloaded games as the launcher becomes entirely inaccessible. Overall I am excited to see Epic continue to grow, and I have no ill will toward Epic but rather write this to encourage them to continue to optimize and streamline their services and eliminate these more unfriendly customer facing issues.  

**In summary : Epic Games Store needs to refocus on customer experience and work to minimize both downtime overall and provide users with a streamlined interface and messaging when their service is down, while continuing to allow users seamless access to their game library to play downloaded titles.**",42,2020-05-15 10:54:34,430

I never had an issue with the game until now, it won't even launch the game! 
That link takes you to Metro Exodus support or troubleshoot submission. I filled one out. Hopefully I'll get some help but I just seems ridiculous that I played the game fine, no problems whatsoever, and now it won't even launch?! I really think it's something to do with Epic.

TIP: Don't just buy the standard editions,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk1q7j/tip_dont_just_buy_the_standard_editions/,"Due to different pricing in different regions, in many of the games you cannot use the 10$ coupons given. For these games , check out the premium/ gold editions. Using the coupon, they may end up cheaper than the standard editions.

For example, here in india, Star wars jedi: Fallen Order, the standard edition is 14.94$, which makes it juat 0.05$ lesser than the minimum requirement for the coupon. However the deluxe edition with the coupon comes out to be 7.54$ dollars, which is about half of the price of the standard",40,2020-05-15 15:39:29,462

Looks like Saber Interactive really do want to help Epic bring their goals to fruition.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gdeyz9/looks_like_saber_interactive_really_do_want_to/,"Some one released a video of their conversation with Saber Interactive about releasing WWZ to other PC stores.  Saber stated they have no plans to bringing the game to other PC stores.  Here is the relevant image from the video

https://i.imgur.com/LDhvZu4.png

This could be true for Snowrunner and Ghostbusters as well.

The CEO of Saber Interactive did write an opinion piece about Epic Store and why they went with Epic

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-04-moving-platforms-forward-in-an-epic-games-world

Some interesting statements in that article above:

>Epic is the first company t–æ have a real chance to break what has amounted to a virtual pricing monopoly by the major digital game distribution platforms.

>Obviously a strong feature set is important for a platform in the broadest sense, but for companies like mine, paying for features we don't need and that our end users don't want ultimately means compromises on development and unnecessary costs passed onto consumers.

>more money in the pocket of a developer generally goes to one thing: making more and better games for players, and so the best deal for us is often the best deal for our audiences.

So basically we already knew that Saber wanted to help out with Epic's goals of hopefully change the PC gaming industry away from the 30% standard, as well as have a more curated store for better visibility of games on a store.  But with this video that someone released today, shows that Saber Interactive is fully in on helping with those goals.

It looks like it really have paid off for Saber Interactive though.  By around 6 weeks after the game launched they had over 700k in sales on the PC, which at that time was more sales than all their games on Steam combined in the life time of those games.  Saber Interative stated this about their PC sales

>we always believed the game would find a good following on PC eventually. The surprise was just how quickly it happened, and how important Epic‚Äôs platform was in getting us there.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-war-z/epic-sales

Anyways, I just thought all of this was interesting.

(As to the video I am referencing at the beginning, I would rather not post it publicly since the person swears like a sailor who just hit his thumb with a hammer.  If you really want to see the video just PM me and I'll give you a link.)",35,2020-05-05 04:39:52,475
Why I am an Epic Store customer,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g5vvbh/why_i_am_an_epic_store_customer/,"- They are much more efficient and enjoyable in introducing me to games that are really special.  Vast majority of my gaming is indie gaming, and I concentrate on games that I feel used creativity and/or innovation better than what you normally see. On Steam for a long time I have been having a really hard time finding those special games.  Sure I can find good games on Steam using their various search features, but they never really showed me something special, they showed me good games that were really not that much different than most anything else with in the same genre.  I need more than just being good, it needs to be good and have something special about it.  Epic has been doing a great job at curating their store and finding those special games.  I am also a GOG customer for the same reason.

- There is no forced updating of games. This is important for me.  I don't have any of the games auto updating, and I typically wait for 24 hours to see if there ended up being any reported major issues before doing the update.  I also like to mod games, and having forced updating can make a game become unplayable due to the mods not being compatible with the newest version of the game, so I wait to update until after the mods have been updated to work with the newest version. One suggestion I have is they create a way to roll back to previous versions, like GOG Galaxy does.

- They give much greater support to indie gaming due to things like the better revenue share and the Support a Creator program that helps with marketing.  This sets up the indie developers to have greater opportunity to make more money from their games that can then lead to a great opportunity for them to make even better games then they could before. GOG's affiliate program is one of the reasons why I am a customer of GOG.

- Epic doesn't have a DRM, let alone a free one, for the dev/pubs to use.  I do feel this entices most of the developers to not use DRM at all because they don't want to create and support one of their own or they don't want to buy one, especially since there is no actual proof that DRM is effective in increasing profits at all, but if there was one for free and it was easy to use they might as well as use it just in case, but that thought would be different when they have to actually spend money on the DRM.  So I am glad that Epic basically de-emphasizes the use of DRM. 

Those are my top reasons why I am an Epic Store customer. I really do feel between Epic and GOG that 2019 has been the best year in pc gaming for me in a long time.  And I am excited to see what Epic and GOG have in store for us throughout the rest of this year.",34,2020-04-22 18:11:56,476

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

**For those that don't know the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. News was getting buried by tech issues and most issues posted just got buried even more. It was pretty miserable. So on 29-Jan-2020 we made it a rule to organize things in the megathead.** 

*Tech support questions and feedback are no longer allowed to be posted (as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision). Please post all your tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

However I would like to hear if this has happened to anybody else.

Let me give you an example: you own the game Ark, which offers a few maps as DLC, these maps are quite big in terms of Gigabytes, so if you own them all the game installation for Ark requires a lot of memory on your hard drive and for those with slow internet quite a lot of time to download.

There are only a few changes, if you navigate below, you will see a few of [these](https://imgur.com/a/j0BryBf).

And in the final part it changes a bit:  [this](https://i.imgur.com/9k3ipT5.png)

There is a new section called Browse where you can select your Filters (Action, Adventure, Puzzle etc..) or Features(Single Player, Multiplayer, Windows, OSX) ([like this](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5c8aab433718ca7a53ceb3b8/5d699a8db02ff01625eb59dc/5ddf56e89c31ec49ead313fa2d1628f4/egs_browse.png))

They removed in the Features Section: Co-op, Controller Support

And completely deleted the New Releases and Prices Filters for some reason (could be added later).

Welcome to the newcomers,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glnd6n/welcome_to_the_newcomers/,"Hello there, in the last few days the sub was doubled in size. Welcome! I figured it would be a good idea to address some things now that the newcomers are pouring in. First off, some of you may have noticed we follow the rules we've made pretty closely. Initially it was pretty easy going but as you have seen the launcher/games bring in **a lot** of tech issues. The community was upset by this since interesting posts got buried so we created the [Tech Support Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/). They are refreshed every 300 or so comments and automatically organized by new. When someone comes up with a functioning solution I usually reward them with silver to encourage help in there.
 
---


We have never really had to deal with so many memes before so we had to get together and figure out how we would handle them. We decided, for now, to make it so memes are allowed to be posted on days when a new free game comes out. 

---

**The mod team here is not associated or in contact with Epic.** There are about 3 - 4 active mods with 1 - 2 active at any given time. It has been extremely hard to find new moderators due to us being in a weird situation where we don't know who to trust. We have had people try and claim to be from Epic to become a mod and had people with a bias (over the top fanboys) try to become a mod. We don't want this sub to be a debate over what store is better or any of that low effort nonsense. I don't think anyone with any sense is going to say the store is perfect right now. We want this to be a place to gather issues in the Tech Support Megathread (the only place we have confirmation Epic checks), share news about the store for those interested, let people discuss the progress/games, and to have a place where people don't have to get treated like crap for being curious.

---

Lastly I will just say to check the sidebar for the rules and be civil. Unfortunately since the community has grown and people have been dealing with the rules we have received messages calling us chinese shills, telling us to go kill ourselves, and amazingly even worse garbage. If you are the type of person to do these things please leave, we don't want you, you will be removed. 

Thanks folks. Stay safe and healthy during this weird and trying time.",32,2020-05-18 09:05:04,515

The community wanted tech support questions removed from the front page, which is understandable. However it has had the unintended effect of questions never being investigated or answered by the community. To try and correct this I am willing to give out rewards for solutions. 

If the Tech Support post continues to yield less results than the front page posts than we don't have a reason to keep a megathread. Now, admittedly, it is not the community's responsibility to help solve these issues for people. However the way I see it there is 3 paths people can take with the EGS. 

1) People can be pissed about it for their own reasons.

2) People can ignore it.

3) People can help to make it better.

I believe the people subbed here fall into the 3rd category. I won't keep you any longer but if you have found a solution to a previous problem and others can vouch for your fix I will reward you. Thanks for your patience and your time here.

Scores were scraped from their respective websites (by me) using Google App Script.

Some games show up more than once because they were given away multiple times.

The **overall score** is a combination of the MC user score and the SteamDB score, scaled based on the 10th and 90th percentiles of each score range:

* 9.5 - 90th percentile score
* 5.5 - 10th percentile score

The main purpose is to show that EGS does give away both good and bad games. It's not all crappy games.

My question is, what would happen if Tenecent decided to sell their 40% of Epic Games? 

I'm don't have any kind of business degree, but if I'm not mistaken, if Tenecent sold their 40%, then Epic would be in a lot of financial trouble. 

I may be wrong, and Tenecent just owns 40% of the company and not 40% of the company's stock. But again, I don't have a business degree.

Considering all these offers have the seller tag of 'Studio Wildcard' and were recently added (added in March and updated in May), I think there's a pretty good chance that this hints at ARK: Survival Evolved coming to the Epic Store shortly, and maybe even as a free game.

**P.s.:** Actually all those list views expandable whenever you left click on them (not to directly the launch button). It should work only one title per time. This function will allow player to track down mods, latest news and updates from dev, screenshots, achievements, dlc list etc. Basically should opens profile page (not the Store page) of the game which contains detailed look of the product and player progress. During the expanded view you can still scroll up and down to see other games on the list view and also select to expand, but that will close the current expanded game profile.",29,2019-09-01 08:31:45,559

Update: None of you seem to know what a monopoly is. Everyone has different answers but none of them make sense to me. I don‚Äôt see Steam as a monopoly as I buy from GOG a lot.

GREAT News! SELF-SERVICE REFUNDS have now been added to Epic Games Store!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gn84xa/great_news_selfservice_refunds_have_now_been/,"# Update: There is now an official page about this: https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/development-update-self-refund-keyless-partner-integration-and-changes-to-ownership-authorization 

**Self-Service Refunds!**

Sometime this week (since May 18th, 19th, or 20th), Epic has finally added a button for automatic refunds!

1. Simply go to your transaction history at [https://www.epicgames.com/account/transactions](https://www.epicgames.com/account/transactions) !
2. Click on the game.
3. It will show your Order ID, your Playtime, along with 2 buttons: ""Email Receipt"" and **""Request Refund"".**
4. **Click on ""Request Refund"".** This will open a dialog box where you can select the reason such as ""accidental purchase"" or ""doesn't work on my computer"" or whatever. As long as you have **<= 14 days since purchase and <= 2 hours played**, they let you refund for ANY reason according to their store policy at: [https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/billing-support-c99/epic-games-store-refund-policy-c101/epic-games-store-refund-policy-a4059](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/billing-support-c99/epic-games-store-refund-policy-c101/epic-games-store-refund-policy-a4059)
5. The money will be immediately credited to you as a refund, which shows up in your transaction history as a refund for the exact amount you paid. In fact, PayPal sent me an instant email saying I had been refunded. However it will then take 1-2 weeks for your payment processor to return the money to you. Time varies based on payment method. PayPal's email said it will take a few days for the money to be returned to my credit card.

This feature was not available on Friday May 15th, or even over the weekend, and I had to make regular support tickets to ask for a refund last week. So I'm really certain that this feature was added to the site *this week*.

Great news, since it means you don't have to stressfully wait for Epic's slow ticket system.

As soon as you've refunded a game, you are immediately able to buy it again. Such as what I did. I purchased Detroit Become Human on Thursday the 14th of May, the day before the sale. I sent in tickets asking for a refund (still not answered). Today I did the refund myself via the new self-service system, and was immediately able to re-purchase the game for -40% thanks to the sale!

*Edit: Epic's support replied to my manual ticket now, saying ""I am glad to see you received your refund through our new Self-Service Refund feature."" This confirms that it's a new feature. Although some people in the comment section aren't seeing the refund-button yet, so it might be rolling out gradually to different store regions. I am in the Swedish store region and have the refund feature, for reference.*

**Automatic Refunds when games go Free2Play!**

There's another type of refund that they've also recently implemented (last week): Automatic refunds if a game goes free2play after you bought it. The cutoff seems to be 14 days for that refund too. You can read more about it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glkyzp/don4t\_worry\_about\_buying\_a\_game\_because\_it\_might/fqzrwaa/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glkyzp/don4t_worry_about_buying_a_game_because_it_might/fqzrwaa/?context=3)

It seems to only be when games go free2play. Games that go on sale don't seem to give automatic refunds. At least, Detroit Become Human didn't give me any automatic refund. That being said, the game price didn't change on the sale, the only thing that happened on Epic's Mega Sale was the availability of the coupon to reduce game prices, so perhaps their system doesn't treat ""same price but you can now use sale-coupons"" as any reason to automatically refund people. I *might* have received a refund if the game *itself* went on sale. Can't comment on that.",28,2020-05-20 21:18:06,566

Games that are Epic exclusive on launch are almost always good or better.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gox6g0/games_that_are_epic_exclusive_on_launch_are/,"Here is a list of the exclusives. (If I miss any let me know, I probably didn't realize they were exclusives)
Much like GOG, Epic has a higher over all level of quality compared to some other stores, there it more than one,  that allow pretty much anything and everything on.  For me, a store that has more focus on quality makes for a more enjoyable shopping experience, it also makes me more likely to buy a brand new game that really isn't getting much exposure, currently, from Streamers and others, because I trust the store has been having a good quality control, despite making a small number of mistakes.  Mistakes will happen since humans are involved, but they don't happen very often, and that is what the refund period is for.  

Mostly from Opencritic when available, other sources used when not.

- 38 games are got a score of 70+
- 3 games with 90+
- 13 games with 80+
- 23 games with 70+
- 15 games with scores in 50-60s (50s to 60s are not bad games, but going to be limited to fans of genre)
- 3 games with 30-40's (though one game with a score of 45 has been massively improved since release, getting the ""No Man Sky"" type of treatment, should be in the low 70s by now, imo)

A question about refunding,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fqhfjk/a_question_about_refunding/,"On the day when World War Z went free I issued a refund for the game since I bought it 10 days prior to it going free. Yesterday I received the confirmation that my refund went through, I checked my PayPal and it says that I have gotten a refund (the money still isn't on my bank account but I know that it can take up to 72 hours for that to happen so I'm not surprised).

But today I received an email from epic telling me that I need to give them the following information to proceed with the refund:

- Id of the purchase
- Email address associated with your Epic Games account 
- Current Epic Games account display name 
- First and last name of Epic Games account holder 
- Any external accounts currently connected to your Epic Games account (if applicable) --This includes Google, Facebook, Twitch, PSN, XBL, and Nintendo accounts --Please include the platform and display name of any external accounts

Now my question is, is it necessary to send them this info since I can already see that I have gotten a refund on my PayPal?

It's also worth mentioning that I had played the game for 5 hours which is obviously more than the 2 hours threshold required for me to be eligible for a refund so I'm guessing that this is a special case.",26,2020-03-28 23:14:13,603

I wish developers and publishers were a little smarter and less conceited about discounting their games,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ei2a4l/i_wish_developers_and_publishers_were_a_little/,"After the summer sale fiasco, where some developers/publishers raised the prices of their games to ‚Äúcompensate‚Äù for the Epic-subsidized discount (most notably, Supergiant Games, with then-exclusive Hades), or simply removed their titles from the store (Gearbox/2K Games, with Borderlands 3), I expected that pathetic situation to never happen again. 

And yet, here we are, at the final hours of the holiday sale, with dozens of games strategically discounted to prices that sit right below the promo‚Äôs minimum of $14.99 (or the local currency equivalent in my country, at least), as to escape from the $10 coupon‚Äôs threshold.

Back in the summer, the excuse given by devs and publishers, for following through with those anti-consumer practices, was that Epic didn‚Äôt give them a heads-up regarding the sale or the promotional discount, even if they were still getting the same cut as if we were paying full price.

Then, the discussion shifted towards the perceived value of games, and how selling them at highly discounted prices is actually damaging to their image. 

To that, my friends, I say: [horseshit](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40691-018-0128-2).

If a dev/publisher can manage to discount their game to $14.98, they can obviously sell it for a cent more. However, that would make it possible for consumers to purchase it for $10 less than that. And, in the minds of devs/publishers, an even lower price would somehow impact the consumers‚Äô perception of the quality of their product, which, as demonstrated by the study linked above, is simply false.

In reality, they‚Äôre missing out on actual sales because they‚Äôre too proud to have another company eat the costs of a promotion. Instead of accepting Epic‚Äôs generous terms for covering the costs of the coupon‚Äôs discount, and potentially put their games into the hands of more people, generating more word of mouth while making the exact same amount of money, they chose to be contemptuous and risk making 0 dollars. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada.

Regardless of the consumers‚Äô satisfaction with the actual product, the gesture of allowing the use of a coupon, by itself, generates enough goodwill to offset most minor issues. Positive Steam reviews that are still critical of certain elements of games often mention their low prices as justification for the ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù.

As for myself, I simply avoided purchasing any titles that were purposefully discounted as to avoid being compatible with the $10 coupon. Devs/publishers with games on sale for $14.95, $14.50, $14.27... you‚Äôre not fooling anyone.

P.S.: Shoutout to Frogwares Games for not pulling a fast one and discounting The Sinking City to $17.09. Congratulations, you just made a sale that otherwise would never happen!",23,2020-01-01 01:30:07,605

Lack of features,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g7s794/lack_of_features/,"I don't mind the EGS. I enjoy the free games, not just that they are free but because I try games I will not usually buy and end up enjoying them.  


Anyhow, the lack of features concerns me. The EGL has been out for a long time now and yet lacks many user friendly options.

\- Can't ""rush"" a update or download with multiple things downloading.

\- No overlay when in-game, making it more awkward to invite or add friends.

\- Adding friends is harder than most places as if you don't have the EXACT name with capitalisation correct then you add the wrong person. Maybe add a friend code option?

\- No user reviews. I like to see the overall opinion on a game before downloading or buying. I understand they probably want to avoid ""Review Bombing"" but it ruins it for others.

\- See what friends are playing. When playing WWZ or For The King with a friend. On the friends list it has their status as ""Online"". The only two games I see a ""playing"" status on is Fortnite and Dauntless. 

&#x200B;

Other than that, I quite like the EGS but it has far less features to what I would like and thus can make it quite annoying sometimes.",26,2020-04-25 23:44:45,613

#Some common issues

**Q1. Assasins creed Syndicate not working**^[Link](https://redd.it/f6yyb0)

>*So i opened the epic launcher, connected my ubisoft account to Epic games and then clicked launch. it said ""Running"" for a couple of seconds before it says something like ""cloud syncing"" before it went back to the ""Launch"" option again. What do i do?*
 
**A.** You need to close Epic Games (make sure it isn't running in the background), open the uplay launcher as an administrator (if you dont open it as an administrator it doesn't work), go to the Games tab, click on Assassin's Creed Syndicate and then click on locate game files and select the folder where you installed AC Syndicate.

Then you can launch the game through uplay.

**Q2. I am seeing white screen with tiny icons**^[Link](https://redd.it/c2vrvl)

**A.** Looks like this webcache bug is very widespread, why cant they fix it already?

You need to close launcher, open explorer and paste this path to address bar %localappdata%\EpicGamesLauncher\saved\ then delete folder webcache.

**Q3. ""Init of EOS has failed"" - KCD not launching via Steam**^[Link](https://redd.it/f8e5vv)

**A.** Run Epic launcher from Steam

**Q4. How do I grab games automatically?**

**A.** [Check out this script!](https://redd.it/f7twuc)

**A.** [Solution on this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/f7yull/if_assassins_creed_syndicate_doesnt_work_for_you/)

*Tip- Once you are done connecting your Epic account with Uplay, don't bother with Epic launcher. Use the Uplay to download. Game is there in your library.*

**Q5. I have an issue with Fortnite.....**

**A.** Please head to r/FortniteBR for help. They have a larger and more active community there to help you with technical issues specific to this game.

***We are a community run subreddit and have nothing to do with Epic. None of the mods are from Epic, we have no contact with Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else*** [***email their support***](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) ***and let them know.***

Welcome to the fourth Tech Support Megathread.

Before we go further, you can find the previous megathreads below.

[First Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/evmlss/tech_support_megathread/)

[Fourth Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/)

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issues which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

*as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision, all tech issues regarding non-recent topics should be posted to this megathread. Use common sense to determine what is recent and what isn't (As a general rule: any current free game or any release in the last two weeks would count as recent). Please post all other tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[**Solutions/Fixes Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing).

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Grand Theft Auto V Graphic Settings Guide + Tips/Answers For Beginners,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0l6z/grand_theft_auto_v_graphic_settings_guide/,"First and foremost, this post is mostly devoted to the game itself and **what takes place while actually playing the game**. All tech related questions outside the game should be asked in the Tech Mega Thread as shown in rule #6 on the right side of this sub-reddit.

I've put in over 1,000 hours into Grand Theft Auto V and I've noticed that this sub-reddit is filled slam full of new players to the game. So I figure I'd lend my expertise on the game itself.

I encourage ALL questions related to the game itself and I'll do my best to answer them for you. I also encourage people that have also put in numerous hours into the game to help answer questions as well. The goal of this topic is to help make your Grand Theft Auto V experience a learning experience.

Don't know how many bullets it takes to blow up a vehicle? Ask away. Don't know exactly what gun is best to take down a fence? Ask away. Don't know where to find snacks and armor? Ask away.

Now here is the second part of this post. The graphic settings.

I've spent countless hours(hundreds) mastering the graphic settings to Grand Theft Auto V catered towards maximizing performance while sacrificing very minimal visual fidelity as humanly possible.

Understand that these settings were created in 1440p resolution. So if you're playing in 1080p or lower, there *may* be a few that need tweaking. I do ask that you let me know exactly what you think may need tweaking because each of these settings are very delicate. Even the slightest tweak can hit both performance and/or visual fidelity in either a minor, moderate or major way. Fortunately for you, I know every single detail of every individual graphic setting in GTA V. How it affects both performance and visual fidelity.

All the settings in the game, all set to my personal recommendations.

* FXAA - On
* MSAA - x2/x4 (going any higher than x4 is not recommended)
* NVIDIA TXAA - Off
* VSync - Off
* Pause Game On Focus Loss - On
* Population Density - 0%
* Population Variety - 0%
* Distance Scaling - 50%
* Texture Quality - Very High (tweak this down if your GPU VRAM is 4GB or less)
* Shader Quality - High
* Shadow Quality - High
* Reflection Quality - High
* Reflection MSAA - Off
* Water Quality - Very High
* Particles Quality - Normal
* Grass Quality - Normal
* Soft Shadows - Sharp
* Post FX - High
* Motion Blur Strength - 0%
* In-Game Depth Of Field Effects - Off
* Anisotropic Filtering - x16
* Ambient Occlusion - High
* Tessellation - Normal
* Long Shadows - Off
* High Resolution Shadows - Off
* High Detail Streaming While Flying - Off
* Extended Distance Scaling - 0%
* Extended Shadows Distance - 0%
* Frame Scaling Mode - Off

If you have any questions related to these graphic settings or anything related to playing the game itself, I'm here to help and do my best to answer them.",19,2020-05-15 14:21:57,659

MEGA SALE: Tell us which games you bought and why! Show off your games haul!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gp0tsd/mega_sale_tell_us_which_games_you_bought_and_why/,"The purpose of this thread is to help each other discover games worth buying. Share what games [you](https://i.imgur.com/dk10jqV.jpg) have purchased and why.

Here's my game haul so far:

- **Tetris Effect:** Great price on sale. Really relaxing game. Love the way the music and visuals sync with the tetris progress. And will look amazing when I get my VR headset.

- **Subnautica:** Beautiful, relaxing game. I have never finished it before so this gives me a reason. The developer has recently said that this game is now complete and won't get any more updates apart from minor fixes. It also has one of the most beautiful VR experiences of any game ever. (Be sure to get the VR enhancement mod from Nexus Mods though. And the mod that simplifies crafting by automatically grabbing materials from your storage and automatically crafting intermediary materials.) *I didn't buy the next game ""Below Zero"" since it is still in early development and not worth playing yet since it's so rough.*

- **Control + Season Pass DLC:** This game is a bit overrated (repetitive combat) but still very good. And thanks to the sale on both the game and its DLC, I was able to get it for an amazing price. I love the storytelling of Remedy (the game studio) and their head writer Sam Lake, and this game is no exception.

- **Detroit - Become Human:** One of the most impressive games I have ever seen. Love the design aesthetic, the graphics, the story, the world. It's seriously impressive. And was available for a great price during sale. *PS: The game has had optimization patches a few months ago and now runs perfectly on PCs, so ignore any old reviews.*

- **Beyond Two Souls:** Enjoyable game. Really nice way to pass some time. Not a masterpiece but definitely very good and cinematic!

Now share your own lists of good games!",19,2020-05-23 19:27:59,685

Avoid,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/eiyo5f/avoid/,"This is not a pointless/aimless rant so it does not break rule #5.

&#x200B;

As of today (1/2/20), Epic took away my access to my account and all of my games. This steams from the fact that I requested a refund on a game (Satisfactory) and, while they did approve the refund (on 12/21/19), they did not do it correctly. I fought with them for almost 2 weeks because they refunded the transaction to my Epic Account Balance instead of to the original payment method (credit card). No matter how many times I showed them their own refund receipt (the one their own system emailed me), they would keep saying the transaction ID for the refund did not exist and to speak with my bank. This was repeated multiple times. I even gave them screenshots of my Epic account showing the refunded amount was indeed in my Epic Account Balance. At this point, there was no other way to get my money back, so I filed a dispute in order to get my funds where they were suppose to be. I even told them that I would if it was not fixed. I figured things would be fine from there, but no.

&#x200B;

I wake up this morning to see my Epic launcher had disconnected in the middle of the night. Upon trying to login, it now says, 'Sorry, your account is inactive and may not login.' Due to this, I have now officially lost access to A LOT of games. Sure, most of them were games given freely by the launcher, but they were still games I had a legal license to play which has been taken away unfairly due to their own screw up.

&#x200B;

So, with this, I am warning people to stay far away from this company, their launcher, and their games.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

Contacted Epic once again regarding the account closure and, after going through some hoops, they unlocked my account, though the exact same representative that I had been talking to this entire time had the gall to say 'Before filing a charge-back, please contact support for assistance first.' He acts like I haven't been speaking directly to him for the past 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 2:

Since a lot of people keep asking for it, here it is;

&#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/a/y8au286](https://imgur.com/a/y8au286)

&#x200B;

There is a print out of all of the messages, of course private information has been sanitized from it. As you can see from the conversation, the only response I ever got was to 'contact my bank'. Well, I did and they were the ones whom finally convinced me into filing the dispute that I threatened because even the bank agreed that no refund had occurred and they did not see any refund coming through the pipeline.

&#x200B;

Anyway, they reactivated the account, thankfully, so that is taken care of, but the funds are still floating in their 'wallet'. I'm only posting this conversation so that maybe someone that is part of Epic sees what is going on and fixes it properly. I don't like having my money and account held hostage because of someone else's screw up.

&#x200B;

UPDATE 3:

&#x200B;

Soo....my account was re-enabled by customer support only to be disabled again. So, I am at a loss.

UPDATE #4:

New conversation since the account was re-enabled. As you can see, the rep Rolly T re-enabled my account only to turn around and re-disable it less then 24 hours later for the exact same infraction they ignored as a 'one-time gesture'.

Hello \*\*\*\*\*,

Your account was disabled for filing a chargeback.

We‚Äôre unable to reactivate your account upon request. To play again you‚Äôll need to create a new account.

To avoid this issue in the future, please contact Epic Games Player Support for assistance with any transactions on the account before issuing a chargeback.

&#x200B;

(I've just sent this as a response to Rolly's email)

&#x200B;

Dear Rolly T,I hereby formally request that you transfer me to another support representative. It is obvious you do not know what you are doing. I will list below everything that has occurred as my reasoning for the request;

1. I requested a refund and it was refunded to the epic account balance instead of the original credit card;
2. You're response was that the refund transaction id did not exist and asked for proof;
3. I provided proof, screenshots from the epicgames.com website, one showing the transaction id of the refund (the one you said did not exist) and one that showed the $18.39 refund was sitting inside of my epicgames.com wallet;
4. Your response to the above was to contact my bank regarding the refund. This would have no purpose since I had already showed you the funds were sitting in the epicgames.com wallet;
5. No matter how many times I showed you that you did not refund the purchase to the credit card, you always said, ""Contact your bank.""
6. I contacted my bank and they did their own investigation. Upon the conclusion of said investigation, the bank determined that,¬†**NO REFUND WAS ISSUED BY EPIC GAMES.**¬†My bank at this point in time suggested that if you stated you refunded the $18.39 transaction to my credit card and, as they had seen, it had indeed not been refunded, the only recourse was to file a dispute/charge-back on the transaction. So, I filed the dispute as per my bank.¬†**KEEP IN MIND, YOU, ROLLY T., TOLD ME TO CONTACT MY BANK**;
7. Within 48 hours of filing the dispute, you turned around and disabled my Epic Games account;
8. I contacted you regarding it and you asked for all kinds of verification information;
9. After verifying my ownership of the account, you re-enabled my account as a 'one-time customer service gesture.';
10. At this point, I was grateful; and sent you an email stating so but also pointing out the $18.39 was still sitting in my epicgames.com wallet and that you should just subtract that to cover the dispute;
11. 7 hours later I get an email because my account is once again disabled due to the same exact charge-back you just bypassed as a 'customer service gesture'. I email you about it;
12. At this point you basically tell me to go away;

As you can see, this entire issue, the incorrect refund, the charge-back, the account disable, all of it is your fault Rolly T because you never once read a single one of my emails. So, once again, I am hereby formally requesting a new support representative and preferably your supervisor/manager so they too can see what kind of mess you have caused here.Sincerely,

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\--------------------

As of this point, I really wish there was a phone number I could call because it is obvious I am never going to get anywhere with this rep.

When I tried to resume download today, percent complete was at zero.

Is the 75% progress stored in my file folder system somewhere that i can steer EGS to? Otherwise, I'm basically going to have to just wait 3 weeks until I'm back in the states and have a fast connection at home.

When I goto Steam I see it like a massive store with a huge range of games and there is an excitement knowing there are hidden gems there (even if i cba to check), there is great value in this mindset and this is something Epic totally fails in.  When I check the Epic launcher there is almost nothing I want, i can see all the games in a minute and the variety is non-existent.  Origin and Uplay have more games.

The curation on Steam works via the sales system, this is what I almost always check exclusively when I goto Steam now (I have bought so many games in sales that I haven't even played half of them).  When I goto the Epic store I try to do the same thing, and after I see those 1-2 games on sale I leave.  After that I have really no reason to check again for weeks or months, I've seen your entire catalogue.

Aside from everything else, the massive amount of games also means the publishers want attention and so offer more sales to get into that sales curation tab.  They have no reason to do that on Epic and so remain greedy, even with Epic taking a smaller cut they still sell at full price.

The only reason EGS is relevent at all is free games and forced exclusives, the moment you stop these things your store will die very quickly",19,2020-02-13 21:31:45,730

Dear people of the future, the link referred to in the solution is broken, but no matter. The solution is to delete the cache, which will cause the app to download a fresh copy. For windows, look in C:Users/You/AppData/Local/EpicGamesLauncher/Saved. I'd personally just delete all of it, your games are saved in Program Files instead. 
And here's an answer for Mac, thank u/starfleetbrat.

""Just for any Mac users searching this, the folder you need to delete (via the solution linked to in a different comment) is located elsewhere.

This can't possibly be correct?!  I will never be able to download it ... unless presumably I do not lose my internet connection for DAYS and force my PC not to ever go to sleep?

Also, it uses 100% bandwidth and it can't be throttled.  Using the internet for anything else while downloading is impossible, so I had to install NetLimiter 4 just to cap the process.

"Epic Games account hacked, but I don't understand how",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bx2m8p/epic_games_account_hacked_but_i_dont_understand/,"Earlier on I got several emails about my Epic Games account in quick succession: -

* A password reset instructions email
* An email informing me that my password had been changed
* A pair of two-factor sign in codes emails spaced 3 minutes apart

I went to the Epic Games website manually, rather than clicking on any links in the emails, and when I attempted to sign in, my password had indeed been changed. I was able to reset it via the ""Forgot your password"" link and regain access to the account.

I had email authentication turned on for the account (which was still enabled after I'd regained access to the account), and my email address has not been compromised. The password I was using was very strong and was unique to my Epic Games account.

How were they able to get in and change the password, given that they wouldn't have been able to click the link in the password reset email? Why didn't the email authentication do anything? Does the email authentication only kick in after the password reset, the first time they try and sign in with the new password?

My new password is strong and unique and I've switched to using an authentication app for two-factor auth, but I'm really at a loss as to how they were able to change the password on my account in the first place.",20,2019-06-06 01:34:24,750

TIL uninstalling the launcher also uninstalls all the games,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/goyrur/til_uninstalling_the_launcher_also_uninstalls_all/," Let me preface this with info that I don't have a good internet connection, not by choice, fiber lines don't reach my area for some reason.

I turned my pc on and launched epic games launcher but then I encountered an error, first with just launching the launcher and second, with signing in. So naturally I go off to the interwebs to find a solution. Most pointed out to try and reinstall the epic games launcher. In my head, that's fair, many applications do that to solve problems. So I did it. It didn't fix the problem but not long after I found a method that did fix it and I was able to get into my account.

Little did I know uninstalling the launcher uninstalls my games too. So here I am redownloading the game I wanted to play which has a size of 94GB. It will probably take me 3 days at best before it completes the download as my download speed's peak is 500kB/s (that's with no other apps that uses heavy bandwith and other devices connecting to my network).

I just wish there was more of a warning that when you re-install the launcher(because you want to fix the launcher), it would uninstall my games too. Or have it be backed up. If I knew it would've done that, I would've chosen to find another way instead of uninstalling my launcher 100%.

Time to read a book I guess since I don't want my download speeds to go even lower than it is.",19,2020-05-23 16:30:48,757

Regarding Rule #6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ifwekq/regarding_rule_6/,"Hey folks!  


As you know, before rule #6 was put into place, the front page of the subreddit was filled with tech support questions. With suggestion from the community, it was decided that we'd have a separate mega thread for tech support or other related issues.  


Occasionally, we'd get complaints from users because of removing posts of some of the larger, more prominent issues regarding the store.  


So, we've decided to change up rule #6 a bit. Starting from today, **any store-wide issues that affect a lot of the users may have only one post up (usually the first one about the issue)**. The rest will be removed, and we'll redirect the users to that one specific post. We'll be trying this out for a while and depending on how it shapes up, we might amend it permanently into the subreddit rules.  


If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this (or regarding anything about the subreddit, really), please let us know here.",18,2020-08-25 07:53:05,813

Hi there.

I have a coupon left over from that sale in December (?) last year and I need to use it before 1st of May.

I am thinking about using it on Watch Dogs since it is listed as a free game for next week. Past experience has shown me that claiming the standard edition of a game when Epic offers it for free does not allow me to get an upgraded edition of the game. I am only allowed to get the DLC's/season pass. However, the coupon is not valid for purchasing a season pass.

Should I wait until after the free week to use it? On that matter, do you think the upgraded edition (with all extra content) will be 14.99 or above?",17,2020-03-13 20:13:27,819

Turning off compatibility mode and turning off admin privileges for RDR2 helped but now we have a new issue. When I launch RDR2 on EGS I'm now getting a lack of privileges message from the Rockstar launcher.

We did it! At least until a new error comes up but for now the game is launching!

I sent in a support ticket and i got no response. Im also worried that they will not refund me the money either because the refund is also with their crappy support system. What do i do?

Kinda scared here epic,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/btfde3/kinda_scared_here_epic/,Dear epic it has been over 24 hours since I attempted to contact you about a breach in my security. I still haven't gotten a single message. long story short I stopped playing fortnite around season 2 or 3 but I decided to hop back on and check out the future update and noticed I had a bunch of stuff unlocked from other season's assumed they were free stuff. So I logged out. Flashfoward two weeks later and Dauntless comes out on Xbox. That's what my girlfriend noticed something weird I went to turn off my console for the night and she noticed that it said my account was still online on fortnite creative mode. Somehow someone has gotten into my epic games account and I have no idea what to do some assistance would be really appreciated even if it's just redirecting me to a place more suited than this sub cuz this was all I could find.,15,2019-05-27 12:26:16,837

Last Day For Your $10 Coupon - Here Are Some Recommended Games!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gax9dh/last_day_for_your_10_coupon_here_are_some/,"Today is the last day to use the $10 coupon given out last year, and since there are no deals going on right now, I thought I would make a list of recommendations to get the most bang for your buck.

Below are a list of great games under $20 that the coupon can be applied for, essentially making it a 50-75% discounted purchase.

*Prices below are MSRP and do not include the $10 discount.*

* **Into The Breach $14.99** \- Tactics/Puzzle game from the makers of FTL. In designing this, they wanted to eliminate the typical unlucky chances and really let the player succeed if they plan accordingly.
* **Celeste $19.99** \- Took home a bunch of awards when it came out. Beautiful game in both art and soundtrack. Great for people who enjoyed Super Meat Boy and want a slightly different pace, tone and style.
* **Enter The Gungeon $14.99** \- Missing those old top-down, twin stick shooters? Then this is a great option for you. Also, two players can play co-op on one PC.
* **The Stanley Parable $14.99** \- For those who enjoyed the humor and tone of Portal, but enjoy choices and multiple outcomes and endings rather than portal based platforming.
* **Untitled Goose Game $19.99** \- Humorous puzzle game as a goose. See what all the hype was about.
* **Journey $14.99** \- Pretty puzzle platformer that does some really cool and unique online integration. The more you leave for surprise, the better.
* **Moonlighter $19.99** \- Old school Zelda combat meets Stardew Valley.  Go into dungeons, collect items, price and sell them in your store, repeat. A fun take on the dungeon crawling rogue-likes and great for min-maxers who like getting rich and upgrading their ways of income.
   * **Hades $24.99** \- This isn't under $20, so I didn't want to give it it's own line. But if you want great top down hack and slash action, this one is amazing and packed full of unlockable content. One of the bests I've played in a long time.
* **Far Cry 3 $19.99** \- It has it's flaws, but a great one to play if you're curious what started Far Cry's latest style of open-world gameplay (previously was more linear shooter). This game put them on the map with a legendary performances from great characters and wild moments (flame-throwing a marijuana field, getting second-hand high, with reggae/dubstep dropping to set the mood).
* **Batman: Arkham Asylum $19.99** \- The first of the award winning, Rocksteady-made Batman games. Explore the massive and dark Arkham Asylum, and take on many famous villains with Batman's use of martial arts, stealth and gadgets.

Each store page having its own colour scheme makes a really inconsistent UI,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cqumev/each_store_page_having_its_own_colour_scheme/,"The page for each game on the Epic Store can now have its own colour scheme, which spreads out over the entire page, and even re-styles the launcher if you are browsing the store page in the Epic Launcher.

This lead to a really disjointed, inconsistent experience where the store looks vastly different for each game's page.

One game's page might be using the main page's light text on a dark background, while another has an eye-burning bright white background with white text.

Having the colour scheme change that massively between two pages on the same site is incredibly jarring and makes the whole thing look disjointed and unprofessional.

It's even worse if you are in the Epic Launcher, as the style of the store page leaks out of its section and changes the colour scheme of the launcher itself, including the navigation bar and other parts that should never change.

One of the best things about Steam's store pages is that they are consistent and it's really easy to quickly find the information you want as a customer. The colour-changing store pages feels like a step in the wrong direction for EGS.",17,2019-08-16 07:24:12,875

My password on EGS is and has always been completely different from any other logins I use so the point of weakness must be coming from their end.

I see that another agent had escalated your ticket to a higher level of support and your case has made its way to me. My name is India November and it's a great pleasure to meet you.

First of all, I would like to apologize for the delay in my response. We are currently dealing with the huge volume of tickets and are working hard to handle them in a timely manner. Thank you for your understanding regarding this!

I understand that you have purchased the Far Cry 5 Gold Edition which includes the Season Pass and you have expected to receive the Deluxe Version of Far Cry 3 with your purchase. I get that this might not be what you were hoping to hear, but the Standard Edition of Far Cry 3 is advertised with the Far Cry 5 Season Pass purchase on the Epic Games Store. Please visit this link for more information: [https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-U...-5/season-pass](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/far-cry-5/season-pass)

I truly hope you understand our position, as it is never our intention to make you feel as if you're being mistreated or that your request is being ignored.

Your understanding and patience are highly appreciated. Thank you for being a part of our awesome community!

If you encounter any issues in the future or simply want to get clarification about something, feel free to reach back to us and our team will be happy to try assisting you!

I saw on the launcher that theres an option to select Directx 12 or Directx11. Directx 12 just crashes and Directx 11 loads, but it just shows up a grey screen, with ""compiling Shaders"" and goes away. 

Is there a way to run it under Directx 9? Probably not. Just seeing if anyone else runs in Linux. Is there DRM in this game?

*There is no issue, I bought a new PC and I want to try and get my games on the new PC. I have very limited internet and to re-download is going to eat up my data caps, so all I want to know is there a way for me to move Borderlands 3 and Dauntless from my old PC to the new PC.""*

&#x200B;

**Epic Support:**  ""Hello *Wildsniper!Thank you for your response.In this case. If you would like to play Borderlands 3 and Dauntless from a new PC, you will need to download again the game. Keep in mind that this will be a new PC of yours, so a download is required in order to be able to play.I hope I was able to clear all your doubts. Do not hesitate in contacting us back if you have any other questions or concerns. We will be glad to help.Kind Regards.""*

**Me:**

*""Hmm, FYI¬† it is possible to do it without re-downloading on my new PC, you took too long to respond, so I figured it out myself, I just copied¬†the games over to my new PC, started the download of the game and paused¬†it, closed the launcher completely and pasted my Borderlands folder to the new directory and just started up the launcher, resumed the download and it started the verification process and done, I am playing Borderlands with no issues.*

*You would have cost me a lot of time and internet, if I followed your advice.*

*I think you guys at support need some training on how the launcher works.*

*Sorry for sounding condescending, but if I am expected to know everything at my workplace so should you guys.*

*I don't know if this was intended for me to be able to that but yeah.*

*Thanks anyways""*

&#x200B;

You guys at support needs some training, because this is bad if someone like me who is not really that knowledgeable about PC's knows more than your support about how your launcher works, this just makes you look bad.

I am not the type to shame, but I was so mad at the response of your support. Where I am there are limited data caps and speeds, it would have taken me at least 3 days to download Borderlands 3 and would have cost me ZAR700 (+/- $50) to download it again.

You want to compete with Steam? then you better step up.

Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition and activating your missing deluxe edition content,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/h80ns2/far_cry_3_deluxe_edition_and_activating_your/,"Scroll down for TLDR

I bought the Far Cry 5 Gold Edition on the Epic Games Store. I downloaded and activated it the first day. No problem. But I could not find the Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition that was supposed to be included.

So I searched the internet and found all the issues people were having. Mostly I found people being told to wait for 7 days for Epic to manually add the entitlement to their Epic Games library. I did find a few other non-solutions: People told it's Ubisoft's fault, no, it's Epic's fault, no the Far Cry 3 on the Epic store or in the Far Cry 5 Season Pass on Epic is different, blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda. Too much shoulder shrugging and passing the buck instead of just helping customers with their purchased product.

7 days to activate a digital purchase is ridiculous.

So I waited. I checked each day. Nothing. On the 7th day I was about to open a support ticket and looked on the Epic Store page for Far Cry 3. And there it said ""unavailable"" and Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition said owned. Great. So I start the Epic launcher. There's Far Cry 3. Start the install. Nope, get an error message, unavailable or something. Fine. Quit the Epic launcher. Quit uPlay. Close my browsers. Try again. This time it starts. Goes through the activation process on uPlay. Check uPlay. There it is, Far Cry 3 Deluxe. I think I checked My Games under account information and the game was listed there but there was no key or hide or show key prompts. Go back to the Epic launcher. Install Far Cry 3. Download finishes. Game is installed. Start the game. It switches over to uPlay. Another update. More steps to install. Finally, the game starts.

So the first thing I want to see is the Deluxe Edition content. Supposed to have some tattoos on my arms. Be able to get a unique melee weapon in the stores inside the game. Other special weapons and extra missions on the map. I can't find them. Maybe I need to play a little. I do the first radio tower mission. Nothing. I do the first outpost mission. Nothing.

Here's the link to Ubisoft's description of the content: [https://support.ubisoft.com/en-us/Faqs/000035395/Contents-of-Far-Cry-3-Deluxe-Editon-FC3](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-us/Faqs/000035395/Contents-of-Far-Cry-3-Deluxe-Editon-FC3). If you go in the game and bring up the map there should be some extra icons for The Lost Expedition missions and Monkey Business. If I recall, one at the top of the map, one at the bottom, and one on the right side. If you don't see these missions on the map then your deluxe content is not activated.

I recheck the Epic Store. Says Far Cry 3 owned. Says Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition owned.

So I've got Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition but I don't seem to have the deluxe contents inside the game.

So I search the internet again. Some say, oh, just quit and restart a few times and it will appear. Some solutions for Steam. And a couple of times they say enter your key in the menu in the game.

So I go into uPlay. I go to my Account Information and go to My Games. Scroll to Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition. It has a Show key prompt. So I show the key and I record it. I start Far Cry 3. In the Far Cry 3 menu I go to Options and then Downloadable Content. I enter the key I previously recorded and I'm rewarded with ""Congratulations on unlocking the collector's edition content"" or something like that. I check the store in game for the extra melee weapon and other weapons. They are all there. I look at the characters arms (get in vehicle to see them, they are small marks) and there they are. I check the map. Extra missions for Lost Expedition and a monkey.

And that's how I got my Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition that was included with my Far Cry 5 Gold Edition.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

* Epic can take 7 days to give you Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition if you buy Far Cry 5 Gold Edition or the Far Cry 5 Season Pass.
* After activating and installing Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition your deluxe edition content may be missing in game. 
* Check for extra ""Lost Expedition"" missions in the game map.
* If they are missing, you content is not activated. If they are there, you don't need to do anything.

If your Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition content is missing:

* Find the key in uPlay for your Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition under Account Information and then My Games. Record this key.
* Start Far Cry 3 and go to Options and then Downloadable Content in the game's menu and enter the previously recorded key. You must be online and connected to uPlay for this to work.
* You should get a congratulations on activating your collector's edition content.
* Check your map in the game and there should be some new missions (The Lost Expedition and Monkey Business).",12,2020-06-13 16:37:40,937

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gs7rxv/tech_support_megathread/)

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Does connecting to the Epic Games Store and having the launcher in the background affect performance of all games?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/em6hgj/does_connecting_to_the_epic_games_store_and/,"I get short but annoying stutters on occasion when I‚Äôm connected to the epic games store or have the program running in the background. This happens in every game I play whether it‚Äôs on Epic or not. If I run a game without connecting and opening the launcher, the stuttering is more or less non-existent, so I think something related to EGS is to blame.

The problem is that I want to play Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair from EGS. I have been seeing the same stuttering in the game, and it shouldn‚Äôt be happening on a system like mine. However, it seems like the store has to be connected otherwise it doesn‚Äôt work. There is no way around this: I tried using the command line hack but it still complained about not being connected to the store. Closing out the launcher after the game opens doesn‚Äôt seem to make the stutters go away, so it‚Äôs some blend of both the launcher and the connection that seems to be the source of the problem.

Epic Games Client Possibly Freezing Windows,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cuzgc8/epic_games_client_possibly_freezing_windows/,"Hello all,  
I just built a new PC last weekend. I have very little software that I've installed since getting Windows up and running: Chrome, Spotify, Hardware Monitor, Blizzard Client, WoW, LoL, Discord, MSI Dragon Center and Afterburner, NZXT CAM, and Gigabyte's RGB Fusion. About five days ago I also installed the Epic Games client and Bethesda client, and the next time I started my PC, Windows was totally unresponsive after logging in. I ended up having to restore the system to a prior restore point and reinstalled everything listed above except for the Epic Games client and Bethesda client. For the next few days everything ran fine, then just this morning I reinstalled the Epic Games client and later shut down the PC. When I just tried to start it back up again, Windows was frozen after login, again. It's worth noting I did have Epic disabled as a startup program right after installing.

However today my EGS has changed currency to NOK and lists the game for 279 NOK for the standard version. Almost half of what i paid just yesterday. On top of that the premium version costs 419 NOK which is less than what i paid in EUR for the standard edition. Does anyone know if Epic will help me on this issue?",11,2020-04-29 23:50:51,984

Epic Games' Extremely Difficult Refund Policy,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fy9hj5/epic_games_extremely_difficult_refund_policy/,"So I've been trying to get a refund for my Ghost Recon: Breakpoint that I bought around 3 days ago. I played less than an hour and have owned it for less that 14 days. I sent a ticket asking for my refund and receive a message asking for some info on my account. I respond to the email with that info.

I don't get a response for 2 days. Now I would usually wait longer, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to respond to that email or respond in a specific EpicGames ticket window. So I send it another ticket explaining my confusion AND including ALL the information they asked for in the initial respond. Around 12 hours later, I get another response from a DIFFERENT ""Epic Employee"" saying the same exact thing as the first response I got (aka asking for the information I literally provided them in the ticket).

This shows that they don't actually read your tickets and just have automated messages sent based on keywords in the ticket. Does anyone have any similar experiences/ can anyone please help me with this?

I really appreciate it,

RR

Update: I just sent in another ticket with the message ""here is all the info you need for the refund"" and then proceeded to make a list of it. No idea if it will work this time, but I have a feeling I'm going to get the exact same response as the other two.

Update 2.0: I just got a response on my first ticket saying that I haven't gotten to them and that the ticket will be automatically terminated in 5 days. Anyone know if there is a specific place to respond to tickets that isn't an email back?",12,2020-04-10 17:43:35,986
Why are games removed from my library when I uninstall them?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fk7zcb/why_are_games_removed_from_my_library_when_i/,"I got subnautica for free and I was playing for a long time and my game crashed losing all my progress.

About 20 minutes ago I was trying to boot it back up and the game kept crashing for no reason.  So I thought ""okay, no problem I'll just uninstall and install the game"".

Spoiler Alert: Nope! Subnautica is now permanently removed from my library.  I was thinking about recovering the files and trying to find the problem but I don't have enough time to do so.
