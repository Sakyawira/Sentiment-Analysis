Copying GTA V Steam Files to Epic Games verison,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0eob/copying_gta_v_steam_files_to_epic_games_verison/,"So Yea Here we go , focus with me ,with every step i do

***1 - For the cracked Verison***

&#x200B;

As i see there is so much GTA V Cracked Owners

You will do the same steps as i wrote down

but The only Extra thing u need to do is to delete The Crack Files (Avoiding Any possible Ban)

&#x200B;

The Cracked Files Name's(  GTA5.exe - GTAVLauncher.exe - socialclub.dll - socialclub.ini - steam\_api.ini -  steam\_api64.dll- steam\_api\_ext64.dll - [steam000.wow](https://steam000.wow/)  \-   [steam001.wow](https://steam001.wow) )

and continue as i wrote down

&#x200B;

***2 - For The Steam Verison***

&#x200B;

Now First You will make a copy from the steam verison (Backup)

take the back up from (SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V)

After Doing a backup

&#x200B;

1 - go to Epic games store And Select where u want to download the game

once u select where u want it installed and start the download

2 - let it download like 5MB or so

3 - pause the download and exit Epic games launcher (fully exit)

4 - Now go and cut/copy the backup u did (COPY THE RAW FILES / Like i copied them In the pic below)

&#x200B;

Like this

After copying them

5 - Now Open the GTAV folder( The one that Epic games launcher made)

&#x200B;

you will see 1 file only (.egstore) DO NOT DELETE OR MOVEIT)

&#x200B;

6 - Paste the raw files on GTAV (Epic games gtav folder)

Like this

https://preview.redd.it/tiyg7nw66uy41.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc0fb80e1a7ce3272b10b7c40118482c8108b596

Now for the tricky part

7 - Open Epic Games Launcher and resume the download

Now here u will see it is didnt work and it didnt verify the files

Dont Panic

8 - Cancel The Download and go to ur library

&#x200B;

9 - u will see Grand theft auto V and there is a small word under its pic says (Resume)

&#x200B;

10 - Now Press Resume and wait

&#x200B;

it will start verifying files

it may take 5 - 15 mins

DON4T WORRY ABOUT BUYING A GAME BECAUSE IT MIGHT GO FREE OR ON SALE!!! ( Epic will refund you the difference),https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glkyzp/don4t_worry_about_buying_a_game_because_it_might/,"Epic partial refunds might actually be the best unknown feature of EGS. you should never worry about buying a game again because as long as you bought the game six weeks before it going free or getting discounted, you'll get a refund of the difference in price.

EGS basically fixed the problem of gamers hesitating when buying a game. To my knowledge it is the only store that does this

I just had to post this because i see so many people afraid that they might be wasting their money. so please stop making posts about this,YOU WILL GET A GODDAMN REFUND....ffs

EDIT: there seems to be articles saying that it's actually only 2 weeks before hand. this seems to contradict the refunds that people got for world war z which seem to go back as far as february 13th which was 6 weeks before it was offered for free.hope epic can just clarify the duration for much less confusion.

here take a look:

[https://www.similarweb.com/website/steampowered.com?competitors=epicgames.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/steampowered.com?competitors=epicgames.com)

this will most likely change soon enough and steam will surpass epic again in june because of the steam summer sale but its really interesting to see the growth of EGS.

there are other sites that do this like alexa ranks but that site uses 90 day stats and doesn't work in this instance

basically EGS is growing at a fast rate. hopefully we can see the same in terms of feature developpement...probably not",247,2020-06-09 13:11:03,71

I still remember bitching when I was forced to DL it to play Empire TW. Its grown on me though. The sales, the workshop and review system are all top notch. 

I didnt know much about Epic until the Batman series was free. What a score! But I uninstalled. As they continue to give us great games I've grown more appreciative to the point that I bought a game. Now Ark is free the type of game I've been interested in but wouldnt buy because my video game funds are limited. 

Basically all of that to say thank you Epic. Your strategy is working. Keep being generous, it's hard to get us to play less on steam. But over time it can happen. Freshen up the UI some, get an inhouse review system and same for mods. Cheers!",239,2020-06-12 23:15:47,74

so what can you do in offline mode and what is the purpose of offline mode?

Once I am on the store page, and able to see the video of the game, if I want to install the game, I currently have to go back to the library.

Going back to the library resets the scroll bar to the top of the list, and I have to go down the list to find the game again.

This can be remedied in a few different ways:  
1) Allow viewing the store video/picture/text on the library page.

2) Change the ""Owned"" button to ""Install"", and allow installing the game from the store button.

3) Don't reset the scroll bars to the top every time I go to the library.

EPIC won me over,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hgegds/epic_won_me_over/,"Few months ago: I didn't care about the newest outrage:  ""Steam vs Epic"". Of course every comment that was in favor of epic was downvoted to hell and in favor of steam upvoted - typical reddit echo chamber, not surprising.

It was a bit cringe though how people acted and still act like we are in a action movie, where everything is black and white - steam the good guys / epic the bad guys.

In my eyes both are grey, like nearly everyone and everything in life actually

Weren't interested in taking any sides, both are companies that just want my money in the end, so I choose whats most beneficial for me, not for the company

At the time that was steam - I had all my games that I accumulated over the years there, a lot of money already invested in my collection.

Then I noticed the free games, which I saw as really nice move of EPIC, super beneficial to the consumer (me) - great games even, not those trash 50 cent indie games that are always given away on other sites, so it looks like they are generous, but in reality they give you the biggest shittiest trash available.

No - it were mostly highly rated good games.

Always grabbed them but thought ""I will probably only use EPIC to play those free games every now and then, still going to continue to buy and build my collection on steam"" - because well like I said most of my collection was already there and I didn't see a reason to move

...And then they started with the 10‚Ç¨ coupons and won me over, I bought multiple games at insane prices... like I am not overreacting - with the 10‚Ç¨ coupon + the running sale you could get games for the lowest price ever recorded for those games, on any store. Not rarely even cheaper than black market keys

I bought like around 100‚Ç¨ worth of games and now Steam and EPIC are equals in my book, I am now going to build my game collection on both EQUALLY, where-ever its cheaper.

EPIC still has a lot to improve upon, but I really like how they didn't just wedge themselves into the market, but also really reward the consumer for buying and staying with them

&#x200B;

""They don't care about you!! They are just doing it for the marketing!! To win you over!!!"" - yeah no shit, like I said at the beginning, EPIC and Steam are both companies that don't give much real shits about anyone of you or me.

Yet I am profiting of their marketing.

I don't give a fuck about the INTENTION of their action, I give a fuck about the RESULT of their action which is FREE GAMES + insane deals and prices

&#x200B;

Lastly I think a lot of you will see yourself in that story. How you first thought you would always stay at steam, but epic just kept churning out awesome things until they ""won you over"" and you started to buy games from them

EPIC and Steam are both good and bad - competition like that will in most cases profit us, the consumer. Because one thing is certain: Steam had it too cozy in the past.",200,2020-06-27 07:40:50,94
Samurai Shodown NeoGeo Collection will be free to own on Epic Games Store from June 11 to June 18,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gra1sy/samurai_shodown_neogeo_collection_will_be_free_to/,,203,2020-05-27 13:23:40,95
An actual fix for the insanely slow download/update speeds of Epic Games Launcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/inufea/an_actual_fix_for_the_insanely_slow/,"Hey!   
So I got extremely frustrated that a game I wanted to download was sitting at 10kb/s or some stupid number like that (even though everything else I do runs at normal and high speeds), and after trying all the guides, I finally figured out the actual way to fix it with every detail covered. Most of the guides were good, but lacked crucial steps.   
So here it is:  


1. **Don't** have the launcher open.

2. Locate C:\\Users\\You\\AppData\\Local\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Config\\Windows (or whatever it looks like for you, you might need to <show> the hidden folders like AppData if it isn't there)

3. Open the Engine.ini file (it will only be here if you've downloaded and opened the launcher at least once before)

4. It should be empty, and either way, paste in (as the only text in the file):  


\[HTTP\] HttpTimeout=10 HttpConnectionTimeout=10 HttpReceiveTimeout=10 HttpSendTimeout=10

\[Portal.BuildPatch\]  
ChunkDownloads=5  
ChunkRetries=20  
RetryTime=0.5  


5. Save

6. Right click the Engine.ini, properties, enable Read-only, apply, close

7. Now, reboot your pc

8. Open Epic Games Launcher, and test if it helped (both for the launcher updates themselves, and for game downloads and updates).   


I've already had a couple other people tell me they had this slow download speed issue, and that this exact thing fixed it for them, so I hope it helps someone else out there equally frustrated.  


**The one thing I was missing in the beginning was to reboot my PC, so remember that.**  


Any questions are welcome. I am by no means a tech wizard, but goddamn do I get determined to fix things that inconvenience me!

Epic Games store is the prime example for buying friends,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hxc1kg/epic_games_store_is_the_prime_example_for_buying/,"The thing about the epic games store is, that you can't really use it. I really want the epic games store to be good but nothing has changed since release, and giving free games to gain users is not a long-term solution.
So I wanted to play Escapists with some of my friends, but as it turns out: Epic Games does not even have an invite system. The map editor is also not available because of the missing features for modding.
Does anyone seriously use epic to message friends? I mean the chat is not really that good either.
Epic should stop buying their customers, but instead do something so the customers come to them.
Buying games on the other big platform (except for offline games without a modding community) is the much smarter choice for now, even if you had to pay 5$ more. I just can't see anyone seriously using this platform as of now.

So please epic, improve the user experience and don't turn into uplay or origin. Because epic is just like them for now.",190,2020-07-25 11:07:38,101

"The Captcha for the launcher is terrible, please improve it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ilbu7y/the_captcha_for_the_launcher_is_terrible_please/,"There's something weird going on with this Captcha. Basically there is a maze with a cheese and a mouse. You have to click on the mouse that can't reach the cheese in the maze. There are six images to choose from. You have to do five of these. Then after you finish all five, it jumps to 5/10.

After I finished 10/10, it told me I was incorrect. Not only a time-waste but frustrating. So I tried it again, same thing happened. I swear this isn't me, I'm clicking on the mouse that obviously can't get to the bitmap looking cheese.

Edit: In reality, it might actually be me... but it's still a brutal ass captcha, you're talking about 100% consistency here for 60 mazes. More below...

[https://imgur.com/a/jF1HxbN](https://imgur.com/a/jF1HxbN)

Loaded up the launcher to install GTA V but I suppose I'll try this again later.

Edit: After one full hour, I managed to solve to get into the launcher. You have 15-20 seconds to do each set and have six mazes in each set, one of them is where the mouse can't get to the cheese. You have 10 of these so that's a total of 60 mazes. Some mazes are really complex, it gets even worse if there's multiple of them with the extremely harsh time limit.

The worst thing of all is that you have to be 100% correct. If even 9/10 of them are correct then you won't be able to get into the launcher. You literally have to have the speed of a robot here, it doesn't help that the maze corridors are extremely narrow, we're talking pixels in the single digits here with a captha that doesn't even take up like 1/3rd of the launcher.",183,2020-09-03 05:58:37,106
"A month ago, I posted asking that hours played be displayed in hours, not days.

When a game reaches 72 hours played, they changed hours to ""days played"", so it would just show as ""3d"", and anything past that would be hidden until you reached 4 days. 

[Example](https://i.imgur.com/vJ5mvc7.jpg)

Not only did Epic grant this request, they now show time played down to minutes and seconds for all games!

[Example](https://i.imgur.com/s44JHGJ.jpg)

Very cool, and just wanted to say thanks to Epic for listening. It's a small thing, but it means a lot to those of us who like to track our game time.",183,2020-08-04 13:22:03,107

My account was hacked ( I got it back) But Epic help did everything it could to not help me and never apologized.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cjzr56/my_account_was_hacked_i_got_it_back_but_epic_help/,"So this tale starts Sunday morningish when I'm a little drunk slash not at my computer. I get two notifications from epic that my PSN has been taken down and two set authentication  has been activated. So When i get back to my place, i had epic store logged in on my computer and get a bit of access to my account. To which i change my password and send epic a help email. During the password switch, it now prompts me for a second code sent to the (hackers) phone.  When i hear back i get a long list of things i have to verify. The list was:  


 ‚Ä¢ Your public¬†IP address(es) (IPv4), which you can find by searching ""What is¬†my IP address"" in your internet browser; if you use multiple devices, please include all IP addresses  
‚Ä¢ Date when you created your Epic Games account  
‚Ä¢ Locations (city, state/province) where you made purchases on the account  
‚Ä¢ Original display name for the account  
‚Ä¢ Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the account  
‚Ä¢ Date of your last login  
‚Ä¢ Names of any PlayStation, Switch, Twitch, or Xbox accounts connected to your Epic Games account and the dates when they were connected  
‚Ä¢ The invoice ID or transaction number from your Epic Games purchase  
\--The invoice ID is located at the top of your Epic Games receipt and begins with an ""A,"" followed by eight (8) or nine (9) digits; example: A12345678.  
\--The transaction number can be found in your emailed Xsolla receipt. Please note that the number is a nine-digit string starting with a ‚Äú4‚Äù or ‚Äú5.‚Äù  
   
So i go about answering the questions the best i can but I'm a little drunk and have to work at 6 am. I don't get all the things but enough that they should have been able to verify me or at least notice i been hacked. The next day i get an email that said they can't verify me and i need to redo the list of things. I'm annoyed but cool and respond that i am working a ten hour shift and if he could just freeze my visa or paypal till i get home. Email back said No we cant do that till we verify that its you.   


At this point, Im hot and hung over. Been working in the sun and starting to get paranoid that i had enabled auto pay. So i post that there is no good reason that they couldn't ensure my credit or paypal wasn't being used and that i would be sharing this on facebook or whatever. They email me back saying hey we treat everyone equally and they were going help me out if i could tell them what season of fortnite i started playing (idk), what my display name was (idk) and what the last ip i used was....  


I went home to finally sit down and try to really figure this out as well as call visa and paypal to protect myself. When i try logging onto epic store just for giggles, I notice that two step authentication has an email option (drunk the last time). I use it and get my account back. I notice that i didn't have paypal on auto purchase (thank God). I notice that i have some new friends with Arabic writing in my friends section. When looking around my account i notice that sunday i agreed to a Eula that was in Arabic for Fortnite. Before this everyone of my responses were nice and professional. This one was not but i didn't swear. And i only called them a Dumbie once. I Pointed out that there was a million red flags that my account was hacked. Like suddenly I'm reading a different language and in a different country.  I ask if i could leave a complaint with his department.....  


There response was we can't help you till you verify your account. We won't ""freeze"" payments till you verify your account. We exchanged responses today about 6ish times. Non as mean as yesterday from me but just me trying to explain how upset i am about the whole thing and them just telling me i need to verify my account. 

My whole take away from this is I'm going to delete my account with epic and not use there service. It is insane that they stonewalled me and ignored what i was saying. Its insane that if you emailed them saying you think your account was hacked they wont freeze payments. If they would have just said that no transations can be made on my account while this was sorted out i would have been happy. I'm just a dumb Nova Scotian, sheet metal worker but this shit was too much.  Sorry if this is the wrong forum for this.",178,2019-07-31 11:09:05,110
GTA V Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/,"As you all know, GTA V is this week's free game. Considering the surge of new visitors we're getting because of GTA V, we've decided to make a new Megathread solely for GTA V related issues, queries, and general info. Please post anything GTA V related here.
___

#Issues/queries with solutions

**I already have GTA V installed from a third party source and/or Steam. Do I really have to redownload it again?**

[Check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/fqmn39i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

**Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?**

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

**I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?**

Restart the EGS and use a different network (perhaps your mobile data), it seems this is related to your IP address somehow.

**I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?**

Once you claim, the game is yours forever.

**The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?**

The servers are on heavy load at the moment, so downloads from Epic servers are going to be significantly slower than usual. Just have patience.

**The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?**

[Check this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/).

**I am getting an MD-0011 or similar error when downloading GTA V (or any other title for that matter). What's going on?**

Just have patience. Epic Games [noted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/) and they're apparently working on a fix, so nothing can really be done for the moment.

**I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?**

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

**After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?**

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

#Noted queries

**Downloads for GTA V are reset upon restarting the launcher for some people.** *I advise anyone with limited bandwidth not to download GTA V or any other large-size title untill this is confirmed to be resolved. We'll try to update this as soon as we know anything new.*

**The EGS isn't launching for a lot of people at the moment, giving 504/503/whatever errors.** *[Apparently fixed](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261132043129413632).*

**Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.** *This apparently isn't a bug.*

**The EGS starts up in a random language.** *Should be fixed as it was a remnant from the heavy load on the servers.* 

**Launching GTA V yields a 'Can't Verify Ownership' message.**
___

Please do note that if you're facing issues specific to GTA V and unrelated to the Epic Games Store, you should try asking around GTA 5 specific subreddits or forums such as r/gtaonline or otherwise. I obviously won't stop you from posting here, but it's just something to keep in mind.

If you have any further inquiries, please feel free to comment below, and I will try and compile everything in the Megathread.",180,2020-05-15 07:55:00,111

Liking Epic more and more...,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gqpmn6/liking_epic_more_and_more/,"I find more and more lately I'm enjoying the epic store. Steam used to have big sales but have paled in the last 5+ years and in fact even their biggest sales of the year I rarely buy anything anymore. I play almost exclusively single player games and have no interest in the competitive nature of online gaming meaning that Epics sales actually mean something to me when I can save 40% off a game and apply a 14$ coupon on top of that for a game it's fantastic. The fact is most games we play for a few dozen hours and then never play again unless they really grab us and that makes it hard to justify a lot of game pricing. About two years ago now I said I'll never buy another triple A game at launch, I'll wait for pricing to go down and the fact is in most cases it doesn't go down which means Epics store pricing and deals go a long way towards me getting more games.  


There are definitely some QoL fixes that need to be done both to their storefront and to our libraries but I really am enjoying it. I went from a hardcore steam supporter (I have 800+ games there) and a hater of Epic to somewhere in the middle but more and more Epic is reminding me of the way Steam used to be. Fact is Steam started way worse then Epic did and I think most people have forgotten that as time has gone by. I look forward to seeing where Epic goes and I honestly think in another year or two if they keep up with what they are doing they will overcome Steam.  


Afterall isn't it all about the game anyway?

I don't download EVERY FREE GAME, but I have a 4 year old so I get games that she might like one day too. Like this week I could live without both games but I could also see my daughter liking them in a couple years. 

BUT...  I don't want to miss out on games like Troy TW. 

Anyone know how this works?

Does Epic have a profit with Epic Games Store?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ijcblm/does_epic_have_a_profit_with_epic_games_store/,"Players spent $251 Million on Epic Games Store on third-party titles in 2019.

Do they have profit with that? Since they pay for different promotions, exclusives, free games, coupons all of this probably costs a lot no? We know they paid $10 Million for just Control exclusivity and games like Metro Exodus and Borderlands 3 probably cost a lot more due to them having bigger developers and publishers + those two franchises are way bigger than Control.

This question sparked up in my mind when I saw a post that Fall Guys made Valve more revenue in 25 days not even counting in-app purchases than 130 Epic Games Store games made Epic in 1 year, is that even possible?

It does seem plausible since Fall Guys sold like 7 million copies on Steam in like 25 days, but it's still pretty strange.

Who knows how much they spend on the free games, the vault event probably cost them a shit ton, Civ 6, Borderlands Handsome Collection, GTA V, ARK: Survival Evolved all for free in a month time, they probably gave just Rockstar millions to have GTA V free for 1 week on their store.

Is any information on EGS's profits known, and is there any proof/theories that somebody/some company is ""secretly"" funding any of this? I'd guess obviously not, but it does seem weird that Epic spends so much on free games & exclusives to get little in return? I know, because of free games, their monthly active users get inflated to attract publishers, so there's that, but exclusives almost always get them a large amount of hate, I'd guess exclusives are to force consumers into buying games on their store, but then there are tons of people who just wait for the game to come out of the exclusivity period and release on other platforms, eg. Steam.

I'm very sorry I don't understand this, but I always feel like Epic is shooting themselves in the foot every time they announce an exclusive deal, they get tons of hate, probably pay a shit ton of money to make the game exclusive, and then at the end, it still sells well on Steam and other platforms.",139,2020-08-31 01:01:29,147
Epic Games Store database website EpicData.info is now reworked with new look and additional features,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hp7fbr/epic_games_store_database_website_epicdatainfo_is/,"[EpicData.info](https://EpicData.info) is a database website of Epic Games Store similar to SteamDB for Steam. Recently updated with some useful features so I thought it would be good to share it here in case someone interested for such database tool. Simply this is the website were people get to know what's the next free games during EGS Holiday Sale's 12 days of free games promotion last year. So if a studio going to add its game to the store then it's the first place that will be appear before it went to the live store.

Recently it got price history tracking feature and now it has [Promotional](https://epicdata.info/promotions) tab which lets you to check what games are currently on sale in entire Epic Store catalog. As you may know Epic Store currently doesn't has any filter or section to let you check discounted games all in one place so that would be useful alternative until Epic implement similar filtering feature or 'On Sale' section.

If you want to check the price history for a certain game;

\> Click on New Games tab,

\> Type name of the game you want on search bar at right top corner,

\> Click on the game row, try to avoid clicking on any highlighted hyperlinks on the row,

\> Scroll down on the newly opened page until you see Price History graph,

\> US Dollar is default, if you looking for certain currency other than US Dollar then first click on USD tag then select the tag of what currency you're looking for.

\> If the game you're looking doesn't have price history then it might be hard to notice the base price at first glance. There should be a circular dot sitting on the side of 'value'. Hover over that dot to see the price along with date stamp.

**Ps:** Price history feature is recently implemented to the website frontend so unfortunately you can not see price changes for a game on latest Mega Sale for example. But since it's fetching all price data from now on it will be more useful in time.

**Tip:** You can change the currency on promotional tab as well. US Dollar is set to default but you can change it by clicking on the dropdown menu where it says 'US' right under EpicData button on top left corner. 

**Personal note:** Keep in mind it's not yet feature rich as SteamDB since Epic Store is also lacks on plenty of features and such database can only read what's available on store database to fetch. It can't offer something that if Epic intentionally restrict or it's not available in the first place. Hope this post will help out for other database enthusiasts.",138,2020-07-11 21:48:01,148

How to Run Watch_Dogs after installing from Epic Game Launcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fm1j6d/how_to_run_watch_dogs_after_installing_from_epic/,"I and what seems to be many others have run into the issue where the game will not load after you've downloaded it from the Epic Game Launcher. The game apparently needs to be ran through ubisoft's launcher. Luckily, it appears that everything's been downloaded all you have to do is run the game manually to prompt the ubi launcher to install (small download relative to the game itself)

&#x200B;

1. After you purchase the game from the epic store, click install
2. Choose your install location and install the game (i.e. /c/somepath/epic)
3. Launch your game
4. Link your account from the epic launcher (This either happens after you purchase the game immediately, after your install the game, or right when you first click play, just go through each of these and you'll be asked to link the accounts eventually)
5. Find where your game was installed (/c/somepath/epic/watchdogs)
6. Rename the watchdogs folder to Watch\_Dogs
7. go into Watch\_Dogs/bin and run Watch\_Dogs.exe
8. Ubisoft will load, prompting you to log in
9. Ubisoft will ask you to choose your location to install
10. Select /c/somepath/epic (it automatically appends /Watch\_Dogs because dumbness)
11. If you've done it correctly, it should say ""discovering files"" instead of ""downloading""

Some of you may have problems with linking your account, here's a common FAQ on ubisoft in case people are having weird problems:  [https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000041756](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-US/Faqs/000041756)",132,2020-03-21 08:55:02,153

So, after years waiting, it looks like we got achievements. However, it looks like you can not easily see which games have that feature available now. As a consequence, I have decided to create a post to store together the full list of games.

Please, help me with the comments. I am going to update the list as I get more info. I have not been able to test any game myselft.

Confirmed Games:

- ARK: Survival Evolved
- Borderlands 2

Games Without Support:

_Games that have been tested to have achievements but do not have them. It is a way of preventing users from asking/reporting the same games constantly._

- Bad North: Jotunn Edition
- Celeste
- Close to the Sun
- Corruption 2029
- Fez
- For the King
- Grand Theft Auto V
- Hellpoint
- Kingdom Come Deliverance
- Maneater
- Metro Exodus
- Outward
- SUPERHOT: Mind Control Delete
- Surviving Mars
- The Escapists 2
- This War of Mine
- Totally Reliable Delivery Service
- World War Z

It could even just include:
- Friends list
- Profile Picture
- Description 
- Games played
- connected accounts (for example if you connected a steam or Xbox, Nintendo switch, or some other account to your epic games account it would show up)

So i was skeptical of all the complaints and was enjoying my games on the Epic store, until i pre-purchased Tetris Effect which was supposed to come with an extra DLC (wallpapers and music), the day came and i downloaded Tetris and it was awesome, but there was no DLC... so i contact support and they have the balls to tell me 3 days later they didnt know what the problem was and that i should contact the game developer, despite my surprise at this answer i go ahead and write Tetris support and they tell me its an Epic Store issue, so i contact support again and guess what? they tell me 2 days later they dont know about it, wow! just wow! i go ahead an ask for a refund on Tetris Effect, 3 days later the ticket is closed with no answer, and an email immediately after they ask me to rate the service, serisouly??? i go ahead and make another ticket for a refund, 2 day later the ticket is closed and a rate service email arrives, come on now... i went to the Epic Store website and asked for a refund on every game i have ever purchased (more than $100), 4 day later someone contacted me asking me why i was processing all the refunds, told her i was deleting my account, and so i did, my money was refunded successfully and i no longer plan on open an account with Epic ever again! i dont care about their free games or exclusives, Steam support has replied and fixed my problems in one day, there is no reason for a support team to be this useless.

My compromised account tale!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hmvfxm/my_compromised_account_tale/,"Well, hey everyone!
I'll let you know my tale about my account which was compromised, to let you know, it was so frustrating!
One day, i've logged into my account but password was wrong, i had to fix this immediately. Well, so i've pressed forgot password, and waited for an e-mail, but there was no e-mail arriving from Epic Games about password reset instructions, also i've noticed an e-mail about e-mail change. And as i didn't know about Epic Games Support and their possible account recovery, i started all over!
I've deleted all the previous e-mails from Epic Games(purchase receipts, verification codes and linking), then it was like 1 year later, i contacted Epic Games Support, with almost all requiered details to provide! So, i could provide them account creation date, IP address, previous external accounts(i had only PSN connected before), original display name, location where purchases were made, last 4 digits of the first payment card! As i've provided almost everything except of any purchase recepit or InVoice ID, because i've deleted them a way before, they said that they are not able to verify my ownership. Then i've responded that if it isn't enough to verify my ownership and they said that without the very first payment/purchase receipt, they will not be able to verify my account's ownership. That was so frustrating, but i remembered that my very first purchases were all made on PlayStation, so they must be on my PSN account! I've asked if it would be okey(it had to be, because it was the original proof) and i've provided them the screenshot of the PSN order receipt from PSN portal. They finally verified me and changed the e-mail address to mine, also changed account's holder name and region, i was so happy to see all my stuff after an entire year!
Well, now i have my two Epic Games accounts and if anyone needs to help with account recovery, do not hesitate to contact me, i'm here to help you :)

Where does parental accountability begin and end?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ir433x/where_does_parental_accountability_begin_and_end/,"So Epic is being sued in California due to kids spending so much money on Fortnite without the parents consent.

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-09-11/fortnite-children-purchases-refund

Fortnite had parental controls to prevent purchases.  Devices, including PCs, have parental controls to prevent purchases and/or prevent installing of any software without parent consent.

For example, my son literally cannot install anything on the PC or on any of his devices without my consent, none of things will allow him to do it.  He is also playing Diabotical, which has in app purchases, but his EGS account has parental controls on it, and he can't even buy anything on the game without me giving permission for it through typing the 6 digit code first, plus there is no payment information attached to the account anyways.

So where does parental accountability begin and end?  Should all these dev/pubs, whether it is Epic, Valve, EA, ect, be required to give refunds when ever a parent claims their kid bought it without permission?  I can see how that would be abused by people to get refunds after they changed their mind and they'll just claim their kid did it, even if the person doesn't have a child.

"Epic, can you please let users first download and only then install games?",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/iip0xa/epic_can_you_please_let_users_first_download_and/,"**updated**:  I stand corrected, Steam client applies the same method (installing while downloading) as Epic Lunacher, but apparently in a much more efficient way. Sorry for the mistaken assumption of mine and let's hope Epic improves its client and network (i.e. more parallelization, better servers, feature to pause downloads and resume them in the next OS session). Bottom line is: It's not acceptable to have to wait for more than 4x the time a Steam user has to wait before being able to play a game.

**original**: *Merging the two parts -- aptly called ""downstalling"" -- significantly increases the time users have to spend sitting in front of their screen before being able to play the game. Steam app, which uses the classic method of keeping the two processes separate, is much more efficient on my config (SSD + high bandwidth): a 36GBs game would be ready to play within 20 minutes on Steam (15 minutes download + 5 minutes installation) while it takes more than 1h30 hour with Epic Launcher.*

How to symlink steam installations of games to the epic store version so you dont have to download twice - quick guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hdg114/how_to_symlink_steam_installations_of_games_to/,"**what is a symlink?** 

symlink stands for symbolic link. basically another name for the same file

**why do i want symlinks?**

if you have two installations of a game (say you had trouble joining your friend's game from his epic installation on your steam installation of a free game from epic, so you got the epic version too) and you dont want to use twice the disk space for the same game, a symlink will allow you to only have one copy of the files but use both installations - saving you data from the download and disk space from the lack of duplicate files

**how do i make symlinks?**

the bold is the commands you use, but with my folders, using ark as an example.  you'll do the same thing but with your folder names. Start the epic installation of the game, pause it, then exit epic games. take note of the folder name that epic created to install, then rename it to anything. open a command prompt as administrator.

type the name of the drive your games are installed on, if its not C:

**D:**

change directories to the folder you renamed at the beginning

**cd D:\\Epic Games\\ARKSurvivalEvolvedrenamed**(whatever you renamed it to)

change directories to the parent folder of the one you installed

**cd ..**

make the symlink, using mklink /j \*original name of the folder epic created\* ""\*path to the steam installation of the game\*""

**mklink /J ArkSurvivalEvolved ""D:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\ARK""**

And thats it! then just open epic games and resume installation and it will verify the existing files from your steam installation instead of downloading them again.

Edit: you may have to rename the exe too to get the epic version",101,2020-06-22 10:32:29,203

EGS used to stand out from the crowd by not using any round corners in their UI, but thats no longer the case as every corner in the store UI is now rounded.

Its a bit inconsistent though, for example game posters in the store have rounded corners, but in the launcher library they're not.

[Temp. Fix] EGS Games are all Vanishing,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/if6fj4/temp_fix_egs_games_are_all_vanishing/,"Yup. Happening to me too, just formatted and reinstalled Windows and my EGS shows no games.

Possible cause: Newest EGS update asked to install on my laptop, I had all my games, as soon as I updated they are all gone. So something is likely fucky on their side when it comes to updating games database.

Temporary fix:

1. Before you open your EGS make a backup of /%localappdata%/EpicGamesLauncher.
2. Open EGS, let it update or whatever it has to do
3. Close EGS
4. Paste the backup back
5. Open EGS again and library should be there
6. Disconnect EGS from the internet. No really. Check Edit 2.

This way I got my games temporarily back, but not all. My backup was old since I don't often check the EGS on my laptop, but they are there. Until Epic gets their shit together, this may help some of you hopefully-

Whatever you got **after** the backup won't show up. At least until this is fixed.

Edit: Edited for clarity.

Edit2: It seems after a while, if the EGS tries to update your games, they will vanish anyway. So my advice is find a way to cut EGS from accessing the internet completely. Nothing a good firewall block won't solve.

Edit3: Games are back, hopefully this will start happening for everyone. I'd mark this as solved but reddit took away the ability to rename threads.",98,2020-08-24 04:44:06,209

#FAQs

##Moving Steam files to EGS

[Follow this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0eob/copying_gta_v_steam_files_to_epic_games_verison/) by /u/Sk_Alooshy

##Moving Steam files without copying

[Follow this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/) bu /u/xevangz

##Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

##I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?

[@EpicGames- ""If you receive this error, please wait 24 hours. You should then be able to proceed with downloading the game.""](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261297169925115905?s=20)

##I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?

Once claimed it is free to keep forever

##Where are my $1,000,000?

It will take Rockstar 7-10 days to credit the amount to your account. This has been already announced by [a banner in their store page](https://i.imgur.com/ViqCwp1.png).

##Can I use my existing RGSC account to claim the rewards?

Yes you can. But we don't know if it makes EGS login mandatory or not for your future sessions.

##The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?

Potato servers

##The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?

[Link to the solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/)

##I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

##After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

##Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.

This is not a bug. Rockstar has made this game unavailable in some regions. You can always work around it using other methods.

## Ownership error Code- 152

We are assuming the authentication servers are overloaded as hell. Give it a day or two. *Some users have been able to bypass it using VPN but the risk is upon you.*

*or* [this solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gkqy0h/gta_v_faq_and_tech_support_megathread_part_2/fqwo7kt/?context=3)

>'Weird Solution' for Ownership Error 152 This error is not shown when i connect my PC using Mobile Data tethering. But when i connect using my Broadband i get this error again!! I do think it's related to some some blocked port in network that's why some people are able to bypass that using VPN.

## GTA V won't let me play in single-player mode. What should I do now?

We're not exactly sure ourselves what the solution is, but we've heard reports that disconnecting your internet until you're able to enter the single-player campaing might work.

Epic isn‚Äôt going ‚Äúbankrupt‚Äù,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gn4t53/epic_isnt_going_bankrupt/,"I‚Äôd like to quash what is a popular argument against using the Epic Game Store in any meaningful way.  Just today someone seriously believed that Epic will be going out of business once the free games stop coming and Fortnite becomes just another game.  

I immediately dismissed this as we all know from stats that Epic themselves have released that user growth on the store is good and the company has recently been valued at ~$15 billion dollars. Later on I got to thinking how much money does Epic as a company really make beyond Fortnite and Epic Store sales.  

So I took a recently released unreal engine game on PlayStation (Final Fantasy remake) and found it‚Äôs sold over 3 million copies in its first three days of release.  So just taking 60$x3 million sales x 5% cut for use of Unreal Engine = $7 million in revenue for Epic in THREE DAYS.  Now consider every other UE game that‚Äôs sold well in just the past six months alone and it becomes clear.

You may wanna go ahead and delete the appdata entry for Epic  as well as a secondary measure.  (hit windows + r and type in %localappdata%)

As it's been noted the manifest files that mess up the launch as for how to get them back...

To get your games to show as installed...

Ok update to this update.  Drag the epic folder from program files(the one that has the games) to your desktop.   Start a download of the game you need to install.   download ten megs...  close it out.  Drop the game from your desktop folder into the epic folder, overrwrite.... it'll verify your folders.... boom saves you some download time.

Journey to the Savage Planet,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gq7qf6/journey_to_the_savage_planet/,"I‚Äôd been eyeing this game since a few weeks before it came out but never had the available funds to actually buy it.  The $10 coupon and sale together dropped the price to $8 and so I finally grabbed it - this is easily the best $8 I‚Äôve spent in DECADES.

This game is colorful, wicked funny, has a ton of heart, isn‚Äôt crazy-hard like a lot of recent games want to be, is mostly family-friendly (there‚Äôs a couple vaguely inappropriate ‚Äúadvertisements‚Äù on the weird-ass TV in the ship), and actually makes you think about the gameplay instead of mindlessly killing hordes of generic bad guys.

I initially thought it was going to be a survival/builder like Subnautica, but it‚Äôs actually a modern full-3D metroidvania (think Metroid Prime or Arkham Asylum), just without any humanoid enemies.  Explore, scan the plants and animals, get new skills, go back to old areas and use the new skills to get to hidden/locked areas, and explore some more.

Overall, this one gets a 9/10 out of me - I just wish it were longer (although I‚Äôm not done yet, so there might be a twist that extends it, or an NG+ type feature.  I‚Äôm bigtime hoping for DLC or sequels.  :-)",71,2020-05-25 21:06:48,278

I wrote an opinion piece on the Epic Games Store and why the nature of digital ownership may be the reason some are apprehensive to use it,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hgavmt/i_wrote_an_opinion_piece_on_the_epic_games_store/,"Ever since Epic Games launched their very own storefront at the end of 2018 there has been a vocal opposition within the gaming community. A multitude of different justifications have been put forward for this ‚Äì the fact that the store does not offer user reviews, the aggressive poaching of new releases for Epic exclusivity, and sought after features that consumers had become accustomed to not being present at launch, to name but a few ‚Äì however, what has fascinated me has been the sheer intensity of the voices that object to its presence. It does not strike me as a problem that is merely down to a preference for Steam as a storefront, but instead points at perhaps a more emotive issue for gamers.

The problem with the Epic Games Store, I believe, is not anything inherently wrong with the Epic Games Store itself but instead arises as a result of the uncertainty that is present with digital ownership. From a legal standpoint, purchasing a game digitally in most countries does not give someone ownership of the game itself but, instead, offers them the right to access the licence of said game. This is a somewhat troubling position for those who have invested a significant amount of money and time into building a library of games on a single storefront. Steam has long been the go-to storefront ‚Äì for many, the only storefront ‚Äì for those wishing to purchase games and arguably the Epic Games Store is the first substantial threat to Steam‚Äôs utter dominance within the market.

Quite rightly, there are those that may be apprehensive about the idea of there being a viable competitor on the market, as that competition brings along with it risk. What if the Epic Games Store were to surpass Steam in the near to distant future? What if, god forbid, Steam were ever faced with financial difficulty or made a conscious decision to go in a different direction as a business? There is no definitive answer to the question of what would happen to their purchases should this happen. Consumers within the video game industry are arguably best positioned to be aware that digital ownership is, at present, a mere illusion of ownership. Whilst those who purchase albums, books or films digitally may not fully appreciate the frailty of their access to their digital goods many gamers have faced the brunt of licencing issues (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World), disputes that have occurred internally within a company (P.T), and even political issues (Devotion) playing a role in a game becoming inaccessible.

Ultimately, however, competition inevitably benefits the consumer in the long run. The Epic Games Store being a viable alternative to Steam places pressure on Steam to adapt, improvise and improve their service for both consumers and developers. You do not need to look very far to see some of the benefits that have arisen since the Epic Games Stores launch. Over $2,000+ of free games have been offered to consumers as of May 2020 and developers have taken home more of the profits generated from their game as the percentage taken by Epic‚Äôs storefront is magnitudes smaller than the cut taken by Steam (12 percent as opposed to 30 percent). The complacency that Steam has often faced criticism for in the past is no longer an option. They must fight for their position in the market and, even for those willing to die on Steam‚Äôs hill, that is a good thing as it fosters innovation.

Whilst this is an issue that has been particularly prevalent on PC it is not one that is exclusive to the platform. With Xbox releasing an all-digital version of the Xbox One S in 2019 and the Playstation 5 reveal showcasing that there will be a digital only offering on launch the consumers position in regards to digital ownership is only going to become more important. Subscription services such as Game Pass and PS Now may render this issue irrelevant by the end of the decade. It is not hard to see the influence that subscription services such as Spotify and Netflix has had on ownership, both physical and digital, in their respective mediums ‚Äì however, for the time being, the uncertainty that digital ownership brings is an issue that deserves more attention ‚Äì and I believe that, at least to some degree, the aversion to the Epic Games Store has been somewhat influenced by this problem.",67,2020-06-27 04:32:41,286

Using Steam GTA Files for Epic Games GTA V without copying,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/,"I want to be able to play GTA Online separately from my brothers account who is linked with steam, but don't wanna have two 90GB folders for the same game as that's just wasting space.

1. Install GTA V and when it prompts for a location, put in a directory you'll remember (for this example C:\\GTAV)
2. Let it install for a little bit then cancel (GTA V installation should say resume in your library) and close Epic Games completely
3. Go to GTA V install folder (C:\\GTAV for this tutorial or wherever you saved it) and make sure a folder named .egstore is there
4. Copy and paste the .egstore folder to your Steam GTA V location (usually found in C:\\Program Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V)
5. Delete your Epic Games GTA V folder
6. Open up a Command Prompt. Can be easily found right clicking the Windows logo or typing cmd in search bar
7. Type in `mklink /D ""your epic games folder location"" ""your steam location""`  eg. `mklink /D ""C:\GTAV"" ""C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Grand Theft Auto V""`. You know you did it right if it creates a folder with a shortcut icon 
8. Launch Epic Games Launcher and you should be able to resume and verify the GTA V installation instead of downloading anything
9. Once everything is verified and installed you should be able to launch GTA V with no problems and 90GB less space taken on your drive

What this does is creates a different type of folder shortcut where the Epic Games Launcher doesn't know its being directed to shortcut and thinks its a normal folder. But why do this instead of just pointing the install location to the steam folder? The launcher requires an empty folder for installation.

Both Steam and Epic Games launch perfectly but it requires a verification of the files each time you switch platforms as it will ask for activation on steam or refuse to even launch on epic if you don't verify. I recommend not doing this if you have a mechanical drive and have no patience as verifying game files can take long but if you got an SSD go for it! 

For now this method seems to work but I have no idea how this will act when the game updates. I theorize that it shouldn't impact anything as the game folders themselves have the same structure but time will tell.

Random ending here but are you guys having trouble with controllers on Epic Games GTA V? Can't stand driving with WASD and all these binds are kind of confusing for me. Also this is my first shot at a tutorial post of any kind so it might be kind of wack but I'm just out tryna help out the people.",69,2020-05-15 23:51:50,290

Epic Games and Linux.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gbx1vz/epic_games_and_linux/,"Dear Epic Games, I know, your history with Linux is kinda mixed. While Unreal Tournament and Unreal Engine natively support Linux (You can compile them), Epic Games Launcher still lacks a Linux client. A lot of the games in Epic Games Store natively support Linux on other platforms such as Steam or GoG. I think Epic Games should release a Linux client, or at least give us some news about it. Epic Games working natively would be a huge step for gaming on Linux. Maybe even with a Wine solution or Proton. (Latter would probably require agreements with Valve.)

Easy Anti-Cheat.Probably one of the biggest problem for gaming on Linux is anti-cheat software alongside media foundation. (Which has workarounds. I think Wine was working for it at some point.) EAC actually has a native Linux version, but it lacks support for Wine/Proton. EAC supporting Wine would mean a lot of games working through compatibility layers.

I hope for a more Linux positive future for Epic Games. Have a great day and stay safe, people.",67,2020-05-02 13:38:23,296

Why doesn't Epic make their store better?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/eki5pt/why_doesnt_epic_make_their_store_better/,"I just don't get it. I really, really love what the Epic Games Store is doing, and I have so many great games because of them either being free or a lot cheaper. But, I just don't get why they don't improve their store.

For example, my little brother wanted Subnautica: Below Zero. It was half the price on Epic as it is on Steam, so I wanted to get it there. But, somehow, Epic doesn't have product gifting? that's just so weird to me, and I had to physically go to his computer and buy it for him, which is not an option for most gifting.

If Epic fixes their store, it would easily nullify a lot of people's problems with it. They'd still find something to hatejerk about, but it would be something!

Things they need to fix/add (feel free to add more):

- Game gifting

- Shopping cart

- Wish list

- Game reviews

- Reduce the processing power/internet/memory that the launcher uses (not a problem for all users, but my friend cites this as one reason he doesn't like it)

- Mods (not sure if this is possible)

- Better support for other countries, in the form of local currency and fee waiving (some countries, like those in Eastern Europe, have extra fees on Epic that they don't have on Steam)

- Customer support is iffy sometimes

- Achievements (seems to be highly requested)

I really wish Epic could succeed more, because Steam definitely isn't a perfect platform either. I just don't get why they don't even seem to be trying to improve the storefront.",68,2020-01-06 08:59:46,299

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hc2oz8/community_support_thread/)

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Please add an option to open the Epic Games Launcher in the library and other annoyances I want Epic to fix,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/if143y/please_add_an_option_to_open_the_epic_games/,"It's for the sake of convenience. Both Steam and GOG Galaxy let's you start their platforms in the library when you open them up.

And while I have peoples attention, having to ""load up"" the launcher every time I click on the icon in the system tray despite being logged in is really annoying. Both Steam and GOG doesn't ""load"" into the library when I click their icons in the system tray after already being logged, they quickly pop into the library.

This might sound ""small"", but GOG and especially Steam has made multiple ""smaller"" things to the PC gaming experience making it more convenient to play games. Having to load into the library despite being logged in and having to switch to the library after having logged in is making me want to use the Epic Games Launcher less.

The reason Im not using GOG Galaxy with EGS is because it takes some time to get the games synced up everytime I start up Galaxy and the playtime is lagging behind on EGS (ex. Maneater showing 22m on Galaxy while showing 28m on EGS, it's really annoying, almost like Galaxy doesn't manage to track it).",61,2020-08-23 22:42:35,313

Why Epic's Giveaway Titles are Perfect,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gnzoer/why_epics_giveaway_titles_are_perfect/,"first of all for those who say that civ 6 is disappointing, let me remind you that you were going to be disappointed either way because nothing can top the most profitable piece of entertainment in history

remember that by just giving away insane games epic can't guarantee sales, every free game they give has to give them results. if epic gave out witcher 3, red dead 2..etc all in the same sale it wouldn't help them that much because its gonna be the same people that get them.

wouldn't be better to diversify and bring in completely new and different types of players to their store, and that is exactly what's happening here: the best selling AAA title ever,civ 6 the most played strategy game in the world, borderlands the biggest looter-shooter franchise in the world, ark one of the most played survival games in the world...it just makes sense

now all of this doesn't mean that games like witcher or red dead will never go free on epic, it just means that epic aren't throwing their best cards at the same time ( which is never a good idea ).

You might also argue that then they shouldn't have started it with a game that is so big and set expectations so high. i would argue that if you want the biggest possible attraction to your sale then what better way than giving literally the most wanted game worldwide. because once you come to the store you're gonna immediately get caught by the insanely low prices on other games( like the witcher 3)

plus i feel like people are getting a bit spoiled by epic. we got so attached to these free games that we started to put expectations and getting disappointed forgetting that THIS IS NOT A STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY

in conclusion, while you might never play civ 6 or ark or borderlands,but believe me a lot of people will and epic are about to get flooded with demand

plus just a side note: how the hell were epic supposed to surpass giving out the biggest AAA game in the world",59,2020-05-22 04:09:22,328

Borderlands 3 download reset to ZERO after 12 hours of preload!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d3j6fw/borderlands_3_download_reset_to_zero_after_12/,"Just to let you guys know, I haven't use reddit since like long time ago, but I have to post here to show how god awful my experience with the game launcher.

&#x200B;

I ONLY need it to do one thing. Let me download my games, & then let me play.

&#x200B;

My internet bandwidth is slow & I typically need 12 hours or so to download a 25GB game, & expect B3 to be at least a day.

&#x200B;

I preload the game after paying yesterday, & after 12 hours or so, reached like 30%. I said cool, maybe I can finally play after work on Friday. Due to reasons, I have to restarted the launcher & downloAd reset to ZER0! ZERO! Apparently also, the download changed from originally 55.8GB to 56.5GB, presuming due to the game already release, & its a different  Download?

&#x200B;

Either way, its awful. I only downlaod from Epic becuase its not on steam. I WILL NEVER get a game from Epic again if it is also available on steam, if this is the experience I get. I also have control, & I couldn't download for 6 hours after paying. Only worked after that (for whatever reason).

Did I mentioned also the download speed is god awful.

&#x200B;

If it reset to zero again, I am refunding the game, & that will be my last purchase on the store.",57,2019-09-13 15:18:23,334

I've already noted some of the posts about Self-Refunds (you guys are quick). Quite a few more  features have also released.

Hey Folks,

We're fast approaching the second half of 2020 and more feature-complete development work is live on the Epic Games Store. You'll find some of the recently shipped features and what's coming up next.

Missed out on the previous Dev Updates?

* [Wishlists](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/wishlists-are-here)
* [Previous Developer Update](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/egs-end-of-year-dev-update)

NEW FEATURES

**Self-Service Refunds**

We've recently enabled the ability to self-refund qualifying purchases online by yourself. When you sign into your account on the Epic Games website, click the ""Account"" dropdown in the top right corner of the webpage, go to the ""Transactions"" tab and click the game title. If the game is eligible for a self-service refund, please click the ""Refund"" option to initiate the refund process.

>All games are eligible for a refund within 14 days of purchase for any reason. However, you must not have played more than 2 hours.  
>  
>You will not be eligible for games from which you have been banned or for which you have otherwise violated the terms of service. In addition, you may not be eligible for refunds if Epic determines that you are abusing the refund policy.

*How will I receive my refund?*

Once a purchase has been selected for refund, it will be refunded to the payment method used to make the purchase, however, this may not always be possible depending on the payment method. Also, note that the amount of time for a refund to process is dependent on your payment method. You can read more on the Epic Games Store Refund policy [here](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/store-refund-policy).

**Changes to Ownership Authorization**

As part of our Self-Service Refunds initiative and to better support offline play, we are making changes to the way Epic Games Launcher checks the ownership of installed games.

This now occurs earlier in the launch process so players are informed if their account does not own an installed title that is being launched. If ownership does not pass this authorization check Error Code: LS-0021 will display the following:This account does not have ownership of \[game title\]. If you wish to play this game, please purchase it in the store or log in with an account that does have ownership.Special consideration was taken to try and provide an uninterrupted experience in cases of network instability or outages. For those instances, the Epic Games Store client keeps memory of owned titles, which it will automatically keep updated whenever players are online and signed-in. If for whatever reason it cannot reach our services, it will still allow the launch of the titles in this memory.If you encounter Error Code: LS-0021, you can review this article for assistance:¬†[https://epic.gm/ls-002](https://epic.gm/ls-0021)

**Keyless Integration**

Today we announced partnerships with third-party digital sales platforms; Fanatical, Green Man Gaming, and Genba Digital to offer keyless purchases for Epic Games Store titles. These partnerships make it easier for players to purchse games from third-party sites, by allowing them to link their Epic Games Store accounts to their retailer of choice.

Players will no longer need to take additional steps to redeem a key which often includes exchanging 20-digit redemption codes. Instead, this provides more confidence knowing a purchase is coming from a legitimate source and that it is directly attributed to your linked Epic Games account.

**Bandwidth Management**

We recently released the first iteration of bandwidth management tools for players looking to have more control over their download options. The tool recently shipped enables bandwidth limitations or ""throttling"" for players that have limited bandwidth availability and would like to perform installs and updates over a longer period of time.

This feature can be enabled in your ""Settings"" on the Epic Games Launcher.

**More Local Currencies**

The Epic Games Store recently introduced support for five more currencies:

* CAD
* AUD
* SEK
* DKK
* NOK

The currencies supported continue to be updated, so be on the lookout for any new changes in the future.

Development In Progress

**Mod Support for Games**

Players will soon be able to browse a catalog of player and developer made mods for their games. Players will be able to auto-install mods into games they own, that are managed by the Epic Games launcher or download the files separately for other games.

**Achievements**

The Achievement service for titles on the Store is currently in development. We look forward to sharing more information about the system soon.

Please allow us to safely change installation folder and not have to go complicated cmd stuff and which may not even work and corrupt save files,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/h04bdt/please_allow_us_to_safely_change_installation/,"This is the possible way to change installation folder which is just too hard in my opinion. The reason why I want to change installation folder is that I bought new hard disk where I would like to move stuff now cause it has space.  


"" *Originally posted by* ***superboep*** [*View Post*](https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/forums/unreal-tournament-discussion/ut-game-general-discussion/6527-how-do-i-change-the-install-location?p=404143#post404143)*Try using symbolic links for a workaround, using* ***Junction****. I use this for lots of stuff because my I don't want my SSD drives bogged with things like email database files. Proceed with caution:*

1. *Make sure all Epic Games and the Launcher are not running.*
2. *Check Windows Task Manager and kill any Epic processes as well - e.g.* *EpicGamesLauncher.exe*
3. *Find the install location, the default Epic Root seems to be* *C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games*
4. *Move the folder to the drive you want it in - e.g.* ***D:****\\Program Files\\Epic Games*
5. *If you don't have the Junction tool installed - you can get it from* [*here*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/junction)*. Put it in a folder that the windows PATH can find.*
6. *Go to the command line (CMD seems better than PowerShell in this case) and change directory to the original folder root (e.g.* *C:\\Program Files)*
7. *Create a symlink, e.g. run* *junction ""Epic Games"" ""D:\\Program Files\\Epic Games"".* *This will create a new ""folder""called* *Epic Games* *which points to the D: drive. If you look at it in Windows Explorer there will be a little shortcut arrow on the folder showing it points somewhere else.*
8. *Test that the symlink is working...*
   1. *DIR ""Epic Games"". It should show you the files you moved to the new drive*
   2. *OR just browse it in Explorer - it should feel as though nothing has changed.*
   3. *The main difference is that if you browse your d: drive you'll see the folder is* *actually* *here.*
9. *Run Epic. To the game launcher nothing should have changed.*
10. *If for any reason you need to delete a junction run* *junction -d ""C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games""*

Just as an update, the cmd shell in Windows 10 includes an internal command called mklink which can also be used for creating symbolic links. So for example, I just moved Borderlands 3 from I:\\games\\Borderlands3 to J:\\games\\Borderlands3 following steps 1-4 here. Then all I needed to do was open cmd as admin, go to I:\\games and run  


Code:  
mklink /D Borderlands3 j:\\games\\Borderlands3  


The dir command in cmd shows this in I:\\games now:  
Code:  
09/11/2019  12:54    <SYMLINKD>     Borderlands3 \[j:\\games\\Borderlands3\]  


Borderlands 3 launches same as before. Somewhat faster since my J drive is an SSD and I drive is not.",55,2020-06-10 17:12:21,344

Fix for games being unplayable due to camera looking up and spinning,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hz5jwa/fix_for_games_being_unplayable_due_to_camera/,"So for the past half year or so I have not been able to play and any of my epic game store games because there was a constant up and to the left input. I have looked for a solution for hours and found nothing, but I have finally figured it out and decided to make this post to help anyone else with the issue.    


For me the issue was that something called vJoy Device in Game Controller settings had a constant Up and it the left input, I have no idea what this Vjoy Device is but here is the fix.  


\- Search ""vjoy"" in the search bar in windows. 

\- Click ""Configure vJoy""

\- Untick all of the axes ""X, Y, Z, RX, etc.""

\-Click apply and restart your PC.

That's basically it, I have no Idea what caused this but I was unable to play most of my games because of this, I hope this helps others with the similar issue.",55,2020-07-28 13:39:40,352

Just Cause 4 Epic Games Version Graphic Settings Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g2urgy/just_cause_4_epic_games_version_graphic_settings/,"I've been doing heavy research and development on the graphic settings of Just Cause 4 for the past couple of hours both in game and from multiple other guides throughout the internet and thought I'd share the best settings that I've came up with for those that want to maximize performance without losing visual fidelity whatsoever.

These settings are my official locked settings.

EDIT April 17th: Here are 3 quick videos I created showing the difference of performance between ultra and my custom graphics settings below...

[Just Cause 4 Graphics Settings Comparison 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U52c6e3cC8I)

[Just Cause 4 Graphics Settings Comparison 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jWUJhZB2KY)

[Just Cause 4 Graphics Settings Comparison 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgH3_wEveP0)

Specs used in the videos:  Windows 10 1440p 144 Hz GSync Monitor GTX 1070 4C/4T 6th Gen i5 @ 3.2 GHz 16GB DDR4 RAM

* Screen Settings: Fullscreen
* Vertical Sync: No
* Anisotropic Level: 16x (max)
* Resolution: Native Resolution, 1440p (143Hz) for me
* Anti-Aliasing: OFF - Around 10 fps drop on SMAA, so go FXAA if you must use AA. I personally don't see much visual difference between the three settings because all the settings present jaggies. So I have it OFF. In 1080p this may look different so this setting is a setting to experiment with. I didn't notice much fps hit with FXAA on, maybe 2-5 fps, if that. Still like it OFF because I'm in 1440p.
* Texture Quality: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Water Detail: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Ocean Tessellation: Yes (turning this off drops 2-3 fps for some reason, leave it on)
* LOD Factor: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Shadow Quality: Very High (max) - Strangely this setting doesn't affect fps much at all, even on low. So a no-brainer to leave it on Very High. If you like less sharp shadows, try High but it's not going to impact fps, just that personal preference of less sharp(soft) shadows. Same at medium. So consider Very High as sharp, High as soft, Medium as softest and Low as garbage.
* SSAO: No - BIGGEST fps hit in the game, just turn it off. There's a couple reasons to turn this on imo. One, if you're a big fan of ambient occlusion in general. Those tiny shadow details on objects that make the game more realistic. And two, if you care more about this tiny detail than you do a good chunk of fps. My guess is around 9-13 fps, give or take. Hardware will differ of course.
* Motion Blur: No (personal preference, 1-2 fps impact with it on)
* Edge Fade: No (personal preference, zero impact on fps)
* Global Illumination: No (3-4 fps impact with it on) The visual difference of this setting may take more time to develop because I noticed no difference visually but in Just Cause 3, I did. Might turn this one on in the future if I find a visual difference. In Just Cause 3, the difference visually was basically sunlight bloom. Or just the heat that the sun causes, if that makes any sense.
* Screen Space Reflections: No (turning this on will drop around 3-5 fps) This is a setting many people may prefer to be ON because it basically puts reflections of mountains and what not in water. I personally want the extra fps boost but may decide to change my mind if I like what I see as I play the game turning it on and off in different areas of the game.
* Bokeh Depth of Field: No (personal preference, 1-2 fps impact with it on)

Side Note (apart from this graphic settings guide): One thing to note is that sometimes when first starting up the game, it seems laggy and presents screen tearing(no clue why but it's happened once for me on like 20 startups in the past hour). Not sure why this happens but I found the fix within a few minutes of tinkering around while it was happening. You simply change the resolution in the in-game settings from your native resolution/(Hz) to something lower, apply the settings. Then change it right back to where you had it. This fixes both the lagginess and screen tearing that sometimes is presented for some reason upon playing the game.

P.S. Hope everyone that isn't able to play the game due to the crashing get to play it asap. The devs are working on fixing the issue and hopefully will relay some info on what's going on with it. I know there's a workaround by just playing the game offline but still.",51,2020-04-17 16:14:00,361

Tech Support Megathread,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/,"***DISCLAIMER***

***We are a community run subreddit and have nothing to do with Epic. None of the mods are from Epic, we have no contact with Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else*** [***email their support***](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) ***and let them know.***

Welcome to the fourth Tech Support Megathread.

Before we go further, you can find the previous megathreads below.

[First Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/evmlss/tech_support_megathread/)

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

[Third Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g3brrj/tech_support_megathread/)

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issues which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

*as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision, all tech issues regarding non-recent topics should be posted to this megathread. Use common sense to determine what is recent and what isn't (As a general rule: any current free game or any release in the last two weeks would count as recent). Please post all other tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[**Solutions/Fixes Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing).

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Thanks for your time and patience.

And since there are no preloads on this shit store, i can only download the game the day after the game releases, that means 2 days after the game releases will I actually be able to play the fucking game because of the worlds worst download client...

A warning to all who purchase from EpicGames.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gfqr03/a_warning_to_all_who_purchase_from_epicgames/,"I thought i'd share my experience with EpicGames and their customer support.

I have had an account with Epic games since they started dishing out free games, because why not? Free is good! I have played numerous games online with a couple of close friends, World War Z being the most recent one.

In May last year, using a ¬£10 off voucher, i purchased Satisfactory for ¬£16.99. I then proceeded to play this game with a friend for around 50+ hours during several of their patches over the last 12months.

Fast forward to April this year and i logged on to add the latest free games when i noticed that my library had cut down from around 50ish games (i've claimed every free game) to only 12. This included my only purchased game of Satisfactory, now gone from my library.

I went through their troubleshooting answers which suggested i may have ""hidden"" them in my library or they might be on a different account.

Neither of most common answers resolved my issue so i proceeded to contact Epic Games Support. They responded quickly to state that they have checked my account and there are no missing games on my account and that i must have these ""missing"" games on a different account.

I'd like to think i'm a fairly switched on person but i thought, 'ok, maybe i am being a muppet here'. I tried to log onto epic games on my ONLY other email address and it informed me there was no account linked to that email address. To try and eliminate the possibility that i was in fact being a muppet, i asked my friend to let me know what my name was on his friends list that i played Satisfactory and/or World War Z. My friend responded to me with my name for the account that i was using. This to me, Confirms without doubt that i only have one account. If it was on another account he would have two names for me on his friends list.

Epic Games continued to insinuate that there must be another account and they asked me for a copy of my receipt for any of the missing games.

Easy i thought.... I logged onto my email account and searched for ""Your Epic Games Receipt"" and it brought up a list of about 10 entries. All of which were within the last month. Sadly, they were all in my ""junk"" folder. It turns out my inferior email account ""hotmail"" decided to place and then delete all of these receipts in my junk folder. Turns out, i am a muppet, and should have checked after each purchase!

I accepted partial blame to Epic Games for this but they didn't really care.

I provided them with my bank transaction ID for my purchased of Satisfactory, But they didn't really care.

I explained myself time and time again, but they didnt really care. At this point i questioned why i was even bothering over what was only ¬£17 and a bunch of games i probably wouldnt play anyway.

After several weeks of back and forth emails they still say ""there must be another account"", despite proving to myself, at least, that this is simply not possible.

My only conclusion is that somehow, for whatever reason, my account was wiped and ALL games prior to March 2020 had gone from my account, free & purchased. (With the exception of Fortnite and Unreal Tournament).

I for one will never use EPIC games again and am appalled by their lack of willingness to listen as well as their system for not being able to track my purchase or search for a copy of my receipt on their end, despite giving them the information any large company would need to track a purchase for goods within a 12 month period.

I will give credit to Epic Games Customer service for their quick responses, especially during these trying times. Credit where Credit is due.

Rant over.

&#x200B;

Epic Games wiped my account of all games prior to March 2020, Including purchased and free games.",48,2020-05-08 22:31:27,389
Epic Games Launcher Is Lacking Something BIG!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/euzwfn/epic_games_launcher_is_lacking_something_big/,"Since arriving back at college, I've began using my laptop in conjunction with my portable HDD (for games). Essentially, I've noticed that I need to use a janky workaround in order to force the Epic Games Launcher to use the copy of my game; which I already have installed on my portable HDD (in this case the game is Borderlands 3). If Epic Games were to implement a feature into their launcher which recognizes and makes playable the games one has previously installed, that would be very much appreciated!

In other words, if I were to boot up steam on my laptop and then plug in my USB HDD (in that order). I can go to the settings menu and select my USB HDD, once done, steam would then recognize them as ""installed"" and let me play them immediately. The Epic Games Launcher NEEDS this feature as well.

Thanks!

Edit: I suppose it's worth mentioning that the biggest reason I began using my USB HDD aside from simply storing files and memes. It's more so I can have all my games installed in one spot (i.e. As long as I have my drive I have my games). This is even more true for my stash of emulators/ emulated games which can't simply have their saves stored on the cloud automatically like most steam games and the such.",41,2020-01-28 16:34:54,390

My first experience with the epic games store... its not good.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d5bpog/my_first_experience_with_the_epic_games_store_its/,"I am a PhD student, free time is a valuable resource. I have carved out one night to play some Borderlands 3. 

Honestly when people started boycotts and petitions I thought they were being a little ridiculous, if EA can make a market place work (most of the time) anyone should be able to. But the epic game store is really not ready for a major release like this.

I go to try and purchase BL3 but all of the prices are in US dollars, strange I have only ever added a Canadian address but whatever. Then I go to purchase and I get hit with a please purchase this game from your own countries storefront. Mildly annoying but surely this is an easy fix. After checking through every setting I cant find anything so I turn to the FAQ... You need to contact support to change the country of an account. Alright now I more annoyed at the prospect of sitting in a chat queue for a bit but whatever. Then I see the only support option is email. Are you joking? I can get live support for the fucking burrito I just ordered but if I want to drop 100 dollars on a AAA game I need to wait on an email. What a colossal waste of time. How are you ever going to out compete other marketplaces with no single feature that is an improvement?

So anyway in the two hours I've been waiting for a support response I have had plenty of time to write this rant. And I suppose if the response doesn't come tonight maybe I will just wait for the steam release after all.

Edit: Still no response from support. Going on 15 hours now. Maybe I'll just buy Monster Hunter World on steam.",45,2019-09-17 16:00:25,392

Troubles with the launcher and now my games are gone!!,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bsdy8z/troubles_with_the_launcher_and_now_my_games_are/,"I've contacted Epic Games support about this, but so far, no answer. Let me elaborate how the thing started

On May 23rd, I noticed some troubles about my Epic Games Launcher. Basically most screens were BLACK and when I clicked on the tabs, nothing happened. The games started so far (I tried with Subnautica), so I thought it was an issue with my internet conection or the launcher itself. I tried to download some of the free games, (Dauntless, Rhyme, or Stories Untold) but to no avail: Where should be the button for getting the game, there was just the word ""Loading"". I re-downloaded the launcher installer, reinstalled it, but nothing happened. The issue remained: I could not access my game library and to get into the store I had to click on the Library, then on ""Shop games and Mods"" (if I do a click on the Store tab, it would do nothing at all) or getting to the store by right - clicking the icon on the Task Bar, near the Network Access and the clock, and then left click on STORE.

Then, on midnight (May 24th), I uninstalled the launcher, using the Control Panel (on Windows 7). JUST THE EPIC GAMES LAUNCHER, nothing else. I proceed to reinstall the launcher again and to my SHOCK, I saw some of the games I got were missing: Subnautica (12-14-2018), SuperMeat Boy (12-28-2018), What remains of Edith Finch (01-12-2019), Oxenfree (03-23-2019) and Transistor (04-19-2019).

I don't know what happened or WHY by uninstalling THE LAUNCHER those games I mentioned were also UNINSTALLED without a warning or nothing. I know, they were free games that EPIC gave us every two weeks, but I really want some kind of explanation here. I really want to have at least SUBNAUTICA back. I've written to Epic Games support and also on twitter. I will post here the links to the tweets I sent them, along with the screen captures revealing the problems.

I hope (and beg) some of you can help me with this issue.

Edit: The games shown in the last screen capture, the ones with the ""fully functional icon"" (Thimbleweed Park, Slime Rancher, Axiom Verge, The Witness) were also freebies that I got throught Epic Games Store launcher and they still work without problems. Only the ones with the ""white funny"" icon are now missing. I've tried System Recovery even doing a recovery of May 23rd at 11 a.m. at which point I haven't started the Epic Games Launcher for the day and it didn't do any good. After doing that, the games are still missing. Also I tried to Restore Previous versions of the folders and would not allow me, because according to that, there are no previous versions.

"In some ways, achievements/trophies are more important than even a shopping cart, if Epic want to attract more publishers/developers to its platform, and compete with others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ex6bj6/in_some_ways_achievementstrophies_are_more/,"Although achievements aren't always a priority for PC gamers, they can add a lot more replay value to some games which are usually only played once, then put down forever. This might not always be important to the average game, but adding achievements to a game like ""collect all journals"", or ""play the game on hard, normal & easy"" can be an incredibly simple method of keeping people coming back to your game for that 100% reward. It would be very appealing to many publishers, especially with the 88% cut.

This is very noticeable with PSN trophies, as players have a level they can maintain and a platinum trophy to achieve, after reaching 100%. This makes playing a game for longer, or for multiple playthroughs, a lot more appealing to players who like to get the most out of a game.

I think it would be even better if the platform added profile backgrounds & game profile picture rewards, as an incentive for players to unlock 100% of achievements (after the store adds social features of course).

If achievements are done right, and quickly, then it could give the platform a massive advantage over other PC platforms, due to how simple achievements are on PC currently.",42,2020-02-02 02:45:39,406

Oxygen not included taken off Epic Store?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/emrl9w/oxygen_not_included_taken_off_epic_store/,"Hi, so a while ago i thought about getting ONI, but then, as the Black Friday sale came along, changed my mind and got a few other games. Now i want to buy oxygen not included, but when i go to the Epic Store i cant find it. have they taken it off? because on the Klei website, it only links to steam. But if, in google, i type in ""oxygen not included epic games"" then it gives me a viable link, which leads me to a 404 error.

Does anyone know if this game is going to be back on? because since there is still a link, i assume they are going to put it back on, but . . . maybe not.

I did a bit of digging and it turns out Oxygen not Included was put in the ""naughty box"" a while back for not participating in a sale, but was put back on the Store. is ONI's removal permanent, does anyone know?

thanks in advance for answering

&#x200B;

EDIT: as   Tizzysawr said, apparently Klei willingly pulled out their game because they didn't want the 10¬£ coupon to apply, so i correct myself if this is true and apologise",41,2020-01-11 03:24:49,408

A reminder for people coming here.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ec18r7/a_reminder_for_people_coming_here/,"In case you missed it in the side bar I'd like to remind people that this subreddit is not associated with Epic officially. There are some people from Epic who, of their own volition, have become members of the sub.

There are a lot of different types of people talking about the Epic store with some valid and some invalid feelings towards it but that doesn't really matter here. This place is a community of people who, instead of mindlessly complaining, would like to give advice towards making the store better in the long run. We know the store is missing things, we know there are technical bugs, and we know other stores are working fine with features the Epic store doesn't have.

With all that said we choose to dedicate our energy here towards trying to make it better rather than spouting the obvious in obscenity filled rants. A lot of posts here really break the civility rule of the sub. No, if you come here with a curse filled rant post we aren't going to help you or give you attention. You're not ""sticking it"" to anyone, we aren't associated with Epic.

Before posting here ask yourself what you hope to accomplish with your post. Are you looking for advice? Are you trying to give feedback for those few Epic folks floating around? Or are you just looking for a platform to rant on? In the end we are all just people, we aren't paid to be here so make an effort to not treat people like crap. If you're here simply because you hate Epic there's better places for you to go. 

If you're looking for offical support then [here's a link](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) to choose which kind.

#FAQs

##Moving Steam files to EGS

[Follow this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0eob/copying_gta_v_steam_files_to_epic_games_verison/) by /u/Sk_Alooshy

##Moving Steam files without copying

[Follow this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/) bu /u/xevangz

##Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

##I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?

[@EpicGames- ""If you receive this error, please wait 24 hours. You should then be able to proceed with downloading the game.""](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261297169925115905?s=20)

##I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?

Once claimed it is free to keep forever

##Where are my $1,000,000?

It will take Rockstar 7-10 days to credit the amount to your account. This has been already announced by [a banner in their store page](https://i.imgur.com/ViqCwp1.png).

##Can I use my existing RGSC account to claim the rewards?

Yes you can. But we don't know if it makes EGS login mandatory or not for your future sessions.

##The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?

Potato servers

##The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?

[Link to the solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/)

##I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

##After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

##Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.

This is not a bug. Rockstar has made this game unavailable in some regions. You can always work around it using other methods.

## Ownership error Code- 152

We are assuming the authentication servers are overloaded as hell. Give it a day or two. *Some users have been able to bypass it using VPN but the risk is upon you.*

*or* [this solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gkqy0h/gta_v_faq_and_tech_support_megathread_part_2/fqwo7kt/?context=3)

>'Weird Solution' for Ownership Error 152 This error is not shown when i connect my PC using Mobile Data tethering. But when i connect using my Broadband i get this error again!! I do think it's related to some some blocked port in network that's why some people are able to bypass that using VPN.

**New solution**

Switch to Cloudflare DNS- https://1.1.1.1/dns/

Change the ipv4 settings. Details are given there.

An open letter to EGS,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjx3jk/an_open_letter_to_egs/,"The Epic Game Store is at the forefront of becoming a major market player and is quickly becoming the second largest digital PC gaming marketplace for gamers.  This is no doubt not an easy task and continues to face growing pains throughout the months as features continue to be developed and added into the launcher and services continue to improve.  I think Epic however needs to refocus on usability for all users of the service.  It is not a great look when your store is down/unstable for 12+ hours and its even worse when platform instability prevents users from accessing their existing games.  I am fully aware that this crash is rarely if ever avoided on any platform when demand for an item is so high, however that doesn't mean Epic gets a pass on it. I want them to do better and these outages need to be contained far quicker in the future.  I am excited to see Epic already implementing a feature that alleviates the game launching by implementing an upcoming offline state for the launcher when internet connectivity is poor or not available, I hope they integrate it into their service so that if their is an outage the launcher will detect it and simply open in offline mode, rather then displaying an error and random languages (that is not a great customer facing experience) not to mention users having to go through Windows File explorer to launch downloaded games as the launcher becomes entirely inaccessible. Overall I am excited to see Epic continue to grow, and I have no ill will toward Epic but rather write this to encourage them to continue to optimize and streamline their services and eliminate these more unfriendly customer facing issues.  

**In summary : Epic Games Store needs to refocus on customer experience and work to minimize both downtime overall and provide users with a streamlined interface and messaging when their service is down, while continuing to allow users seamless access to their game library to play downloaded titles.**",37,2020-05-15 10:54:34,422

Someone got into my account and bought me a game,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glf01h/someone_got_into_my_account_and_bought_me_a_game/,"I got an email today saying that I bought The Crew 2, but I didn't buy it so I checked my Epic games store and I saw that my username changed. Weird. Then I checked my email again and I saw that I got another few emails with some codes that I presume would be used for changing my password if the person that got into my account had access to my email. I checked and found out that those emails with codes were sent AFTER the email about the game being sold. I have 2 step verification active so I have no idea how could anyone get into my account. Any idea why would anyone buy me a game and only after that they would try to change my password? I checked and they didn't use my Visa card for the purchase.

TIP: Don't just buy the standard editions,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk1q7j/tip_dont_just_buy_the_standard_editions/,"Due to different pricing in different regions, in many of the games you cannot use the 10$ coupons given. For these games , check out the premium/ gold editions. Using the coupon, they may end up cheaper than the standard editions.

For example, here in india, Star wars jedi: Fallen Order, the standard edition is 14.94$, which makes it juat 0.05$ lesser than the minimum requirement for the coupon. However the deluxe edition with the coupon comes out to be 7.54$ dollars, which is about half of the price of the standard",39,2020-05-15 15:39:29,453

Looks like Saber Interactive really do want to help Epic bring their goals to fruition.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gdeyz9/looks_like_saber_interactive_really_do_want_to/,"Some one released a video of their conversation with Saber Interactive about releasing WWZ to other PC stores.  Saber stated they have no plans to bringing the game to other PC stores.  Here is the relevant image from the video

https://i.imgur.com/LDhvZu4.png

This could be true for Snowrunner and Ghostbusters as well.

The CEO of Saber Interactive did write an opinion piece about Epic Store and why they went with Epic

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-04-moving-platforms-forward-in-an-epic-games-world

Some interesting statements in that article above:

>Epic is the first company t–æ have a real chance to break what has amounted to a virtual pricing monopoly by the major digital game distribution platforms.

>Obviously a strong feature set is important for a platform in the broadest sense, but for companies like mine, paying for features we don't need and that our end users don't want ultimately means compromises on development and unnecessary costs passed onto consumers.

>more money in the pocket of a developer generally goes to one thing: making more and better games for players, and so the best deal for us is often the best deal for our audiences.

So basically we already knew that Saber wanted to help out with Epic's goals of hopefully change the PC gaming industry away from the 30% standard, as well as have a more curated store for better visibility of games on a store.  But with this video that someone released today, shows that Saber Interactive is fully in on helping with those goals.

It looks like it really have paid off for Saber Interactive though.  By around 6 weeks after the game launched they had over 700k in sales on the PC, which at that time was more sales than all their games on Steam combined in the life time of those games.  Saber Interative stated this about their PC sales

>we always believed the game would find a good following on PC eventually. The surprise was just how quickly it happened, and how important Epic‚Äôs platform was in getting us there.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-war-z/epic-sales

Anyways, I just thought all of this was interesting.

(As to the video I am referencing at the beginning, I would rather not post it publicly since the person swears like a sailor who just hit his thumb with a hammer.  If you really want to see the video just PM me and I'll give you a link.)",36,2020-05-05 04:39:52,466
Why I am an Epic Store customer,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g5vvbh/why_i_am_an_epic_store_customer/,"- They are much more efficient and enjoyable in introducing me to games that are really special.  Vast majority of my gaming is indie gaming, and I concentrate on games that I feel used creativity and/or innovation better than what you normally see. On Steam for a long time I have been having a really hard time finding those special games.  Sure I can find good games on Steam using their various search features, but they never really showed me something special, they showed me good games that were really not that much different than most anything else with in the same genre.  I need more than just being good, it needs to be good and have something special about it.  Epic has been doing a great job at curating their store and finding those special games.  I am also a GOG customer for the same reason.

- There is no forced updating of games. This is important for me.  I don't have any of the games auto updating, and I typically wait for 24 hours to see if there ended up being any reported major issues before doing the update.  I also like to mod games, and having forced updating can make a game become unplayable due to the mods not being compatible with the newest version of the game, so I wait to update until after the mods have been updated to work with the newest version. One suggestion I have is they create a way to roll back to previous versions, like GOG Galaxy does.

- They give much greater support to indie gaming due to things like the better revenue share and the Support a Creator program that helps with marketing.  This sets up the indie developers to have greater opportunity to make more money from their games that can then lead to a great opportunity for them to make even better games then they could before. GOG's affiliate program is one of the reasons why I am a customer of GOG.

- Epic doesn't have a DRM, let alone a free one, for the dev/pubs to use.  I do feel this entices most of the developers to not use DRM at all because they don't want to create and support one of their own or they don't want to buy one, especially since there is no actual proof that DRM is effective in increasing profits at all, but if there was one for free and it was easy to use they might as well as use it just in case, but that thought would be different when they have to actually spend money on the DRM.  So I am glad that Epic basically de-emphasizes the use of DRM. 

Those are my top reasons why I am an Epic Store customer. I really do feel between Epic and GOG that 2019 has been the best year in pc gaming for me in a long time.  And I am excited to see what Epic and GOG have in store for us throughout the rest of this year.",39,2020-04-22 18:11:56,467

**Welcome to the Tech Support Megathread, now for a third time since it was first created. Before we go further, you can find the previous two posts below.**

[First Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/evmlss/tech_support_megathread/)

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

**For those that don't know the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. News was getting buried by tech issues and most issues posted just got buried even more. It was pretty miserable. So on 29-Jan-2020 we made it a rule to organize things in the megathead.** 

*Tech support questions and feedback are no longer allowed to be posted (as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision). Please post all your tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

To find a Moderator made attempt at organizing some of these issues check out this

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Thanks for your time and patience.

Epic Games Launcher account apparently hacked.,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bx8xcb/epic_games_launcher_account_apparently_hacked/,"Let me start from when my account was created. A few days after my account was created I got two friend requests; something unexpected given that I didn't played any game whatsoever and they already knew my name. One was a English written name that I don't remember, the other was a Japanese name (I know cause I was studying Japanese last year). I declined and thought of it as someone misspelling my nickname. Last week my name got changed to this Japanese written name „ÇÜ„ÅÜ„ÅÑ„Åö„Åî„Å£„Å©. I tried googling it but nothing came up. I was expecting to see my name when trying to translate it. That was not the case. Just in case I deleted my credit card info and sent a token to Epic Games Support, which was useless.  
However I would like to hear if this has happened to anybody else.  
I know that I can easily change my name back but that's not the point. My name was changed without my consent and support is trying to change my name without giving me any explanations like nothing happened. Any idea on how should I proceed?",39,2019-06-06 10:33:41,474
Suggestion: Add an option to choose which dlc to install before downloading them all,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/i653tx/suggestion_add_an_option_to_choose_which_dlc_to/,"Hi, new user of the Store here. I've noticed that it is impossible to choose which dlc to download alongside a game and you can only disable them once they've been all downloaded.

Let me give you an example: you own the game Ark, which offers a few maps as DLC, these maps are quite big in terms of Gigabytes, so if you own them all the game installation for Ark requires a lot of memory on your hard drive and for those with slow internet quite a lot of time to download.

In conclusion please consider adding a way to choose which dlc to install from the ones you own for each game",36,2020-08-09 07:25:08,475

I have no clue what to do have done tons of research on how to fix it but nothing works. If anyone can help me I would really appreciate it thank you !!",31,2019-09-16 17:54:03,494
