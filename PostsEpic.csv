I thought that it won´t restart the download because I have downloaded from epic before and it didn´t happen to me so I ignored the warning and exited epic anyway... but today I wanted to resume the download but when I opened up epic it said I have 0% downloaded... and it also deleted the files it downloaded... I was speechless since this is such a stupid mechanic... I don´t want to let my pc running when I am not at home so it should be possible for me to pause the download and resume even after exiting epic... soo is there any way around this ?

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-09-11/fortnite-children-purchases-refund

Fortnite had parental controls to prevent purchases.  Devices, including PCs, have parental controls to prevent purchases and/or prevent installing of any software without parent consent.

For example, my son literally cannot install anything on the PC or on any of his devices without my consent, none of things will allow him to do it.  He is also playing Diabotical, which has in app purchases, but his EGS account has parental controls on it, and he can't even buy anything on the game without me giving permission for it through typing the 6 digit code first, plus there is no payment information attached to the account anyways.

So where does parental accountability begin and end?  Should all these dev/pubs, whether it is Epic, Valve, EA, ect, be required to give refunds when ever a parent claims their kid bought it without permission?  I can see how that would be abused by people to get refunds after they changed their mind and they'll just claim their kid did it, even if the person doesn't have a child.

Say for instance after restarting a download. You can find out why it is stuck. There's a big chance it's trying to find stuff on your disk.

Use Process Monitor to find out: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)

Toggle the toolbar to look like this in order to only monitor disc activity.

Set up an include filter like this. (Click the white and blue filter cone in the toolbar above.)

Then add the green ones down here.

On my end these rows were alternating. So I figured something in the db was pointing to a folder that didn't exist. See image.

So in my case, the solution was to delete the webcache folder in order to remove the database. When I did, and restarted (as admin, always, just to be sure) it worked immediately again. The database was recreated just when the launcher started. In my experience, deleting within the /users/\[Username\]/appdata/local/EpicGamesLauncher folder is reasonably safe. The worst thing seems to be having to login again.

If in your case, there is no reoccurring pattern, it's probably just doing an integrity check. In that case I'd just wait. But if something is over and over being queried unsuccessfully for a long time, something might be wrong. Just like in my case.
