I thought that it won´t restart the download because I have downloaded from epic before and it didn´t happen to me so I ignored the warning and exited epic anyway... but today I wanted to resume the download but when I opened up epic it said I have 0% downloaded... and it also deleted the files it downloaded... I was speechless since this is such a stupid mechanic... I don´t want to let my pc running when I am not at home so it should be possible for me to pause the download and resume even after exiting epic... soo is there any way around this ?

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-09-11/fortnite-children-purchases-refund

Fortnite had parental controls to prevent purchases.  Devices, including PCs, have parental controls to prevent purchases and/or prevent installing of any software without parent consent.

For example, my son literally cannot install anything on the PC or on any of his devices without my consent, none of things will allow him to do it.  He is also playing Diabotical, which has in app purchases, but his EGS account has parental controls on it, and he can't even buy anything on the game without me giving permission for it through typing the 6 digit code first, plus there is no payment information attached to the account anyways.

So where does parental accountability begin and end?  Should all these dev/pubs, whether it is Epic, Valve, EA, ect, be required to give refunds when ever a parent claims their kid bought it without permission?  I can see how that would be abused by people to get refunds after they changed their mind and they'll just claim their kid did it, even if the person doesn't have a child.

Say for instance after restarting a download. You can find out why it is stuck. There's a big chance it's trying to find stuff on your disk.

Use Process Monitor to find out: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)

Toggle the toolbar to look like this in order to only monitor disc activity.

Set up an include filter like this. (Click the white and blue filter cone in the toolbar above.)

Then add the green ones down here.

On my end these rows were alternating. So I figured something in the db was pointing to a folder that didn't exist. See image.

So in my case, the solution was to delete the webcache folder in order to remove the database. When I did, and restarted (as admin, always, just to be sure) it worked immediately again. The database was recreated just when the launcher started. In my experience, deleting within the /users/\[Username\]/appdata/local/EpicGamesLauncher folder is reasonably safe. The worst thing seems to be having to login again.

If in your case, there is no reoccurring pattern, it's probably just doing an integrity check. In that case I'd just wait. But if something is over and over being queried unsuccessfully for a long time, something might be wrong. Just like in my case.

EGS used to stand out from the crowd by not using any round corners in their UI, but thats no longer the case as every corner in the store UI is now rounded.

Its a bit inconsistent though, for example game posters in the store have rounded corners, but in the launcher library they're not.

I got it for £29.99 (It was £39.99 but I had a £10 voucher from the mega-save scheme) I played a total of 52 minutes of it and asked for a refund since I was not enjoying it.

I looked further into the game and decided to give it another try. I was told by an Epic employee to just re-purchase it and I have another two hours to check if I want a refund, great right?

I tried to purchase it again but the price was back to £39.99 and my voucher was gone! This was ALL within 24 hours. Epic is telling me that I cannot get my voucher back and to pay full price.

Surely keeping a customer is more important than losing one over £10? I've had issues with different companies before and they are always helpful.

I understand that they have literally zero obligation to help me out, but I just feel bummed out that they won't at least take £10 off the game and now I feel like I will be paying more for a product I had less than 24 hours ago.

I'm a student and funds are tight so it's not like £10 is nothing to me. I'm just very disappointed in Epic.

1599427865,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/inufea/an_actual_fix_for_the_insanely_slow/,"Hey!   
So I got extremely frustrated that a game I wanted to download was sitting at 10kb/s or some stupid number like that (even though everything else I do runs at normal and high speeds), and after trying all the guides, I finally figured out the actual way to fix it with every detail covered. Most of the guides were good, but lacked crucial steps.   
So here it is:  


1. **Don't** have the launcher open.

2. Locate C:\\Users\\You\\AppData\\Local\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Config\\Windows (or whatever it looks like for you, you might need to &lt;show&gt; the hidden folders like AppData if it isn't there)

3. Open the Engine.ini file (it will only be here if you've downloaded and opened the launcher at least once before)

4. It should be empty, and either way, paste in (as the only text in the file):  


\[HTTP\] HttpTimeout=10 HttpConnectionTimeout=10 HttpReceiveTimeout=10 HttpSendTimeout=10

\[Portal.BuildPatch\]  
ChunkDownloads=5  
ChunkRetries=20  
RetryTime=0.5  


5. Save

6. Right click the Engine.ini, properties, enable Read-only, apply, close

7. Now, reboot your pc

8. Open Epic Games Launcher, and test if it helped (both for the launcher updates themselves, and for game downloads and updates).   


I've already had a couple other people tell me they had this slow download speed issue, and that this exact thing fixed it for them, so I hope it helps someone else out there equally frustrated.  


**The one thing I was missing in the beginning was to reboot my PC, so remember that.**  


Any questions are welcome. I am by no means a tech wizard, but goddamn do I get determined to fix things that inconvenience me!

Then, I started the download again and it did well (in my case around 10MB/s), but in some cases it can return to the 0.00B/s problem. If it occur you have to repeat the process, closing and opening again in administrator mode.

\*\*We are a community run subreddit and have no affiliation with Epic. None of the moderators are from Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else please \[email Epic Games customer support\]([https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service)) and let them know.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the Community Support Thread\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

&amp;#x200B;

\[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/idc11v/community\_support\_thread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/idc11v/community_support_thread/))

&amp;#x200B;

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Solutions/Fixes Google Doc\]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v\_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing))

&amp;#x200B;

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time and patience.

After I finished 10/10, it told me I was incorrect. Not only a time-waste but frustrating. So I tried it again, same thing happened. I swear this isn't me, I'm clicking on the mouse that obviously can't get to the bitmap looking cheese.

• The invoice ID or transaction number from your Epic Games purchase.

Then, once I did it, it tells me that I entered the incorrect password, which I then found out I did.

HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME THAT FIRST SO I DON'T WASTE MY TIME, THEN????

So, I entered the correct password, and now I'm stuck in an endless loop of this godforsaken mouse maze. If I get a single one incorrect, I have to do all 10 again. How in the hell is this a verification?

1598792489,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ijcblm/does_epic_have_a_profit_with_epic_games_store/," Epic earned $251 Million from third-party titles in 2019.

Do they have profit with that? Since they pay for different promotions, exclusives, free games, coupons all of this probably costs a lot no? We know they paid $10 Million for just Control exclusivity and games like Metro Exodus and Borderlands 3 probably cost a lot more due to them having bigger developers and publishers + those two franchises are way bigger than Control.

This question sparked up in my mind when I saw a post that Fall Guys made Valve more revenue in 25 days not even counting in-app purchases than 130 Epic Games Store games made Epic in 1 year, is that even possible?

It does seem plausible since Fall Guys sold like 7 million copies on Steam in like 25 days, but it's still pretty strange.

Who knows how much they spend on the free games, the vault event probably cost them a shit ton, Civ 6, Borderlands Handsome Collection, GTA V, ARK: Survival Evolved all for free in a month time, they probably gave just Rockstar millions to have GTA V free for 1 week on their store.

Is any information on EGS's profits known, and is anyone ""secretly"" funding any of this? I'd guess obviously not, but it does seem weird that Epic spends so much on free games &amp; exclusives to get little in return? I know, because of free games, their monthly active users get inflated to attract publishers, so there's that, but exclusives almost always get them a large amount of hate, I'd guess exclusives are to force consumers into buying games on their store, but then there are tons of people who just wait for the game to come out of the exclusivity period and release on other platforms, eg. Steam.

I'm very sorry I don't understand this, but I always feel like Epic is shooting themselves in the foot every time they announce an exclusive deal, they get tons of hate, probably pay a shit ton of money to make the game exclusive, and then at the end, it still sells well on Steam and other platforms.",Does Epic have a profit with Epic Games Store?,1.0,1598749289.0,2020-08-31 01:01:29

This just happens with EPIC LAUNCHER, I'm using Steam at 4K resolution without problems, I have a GTX 1070 and 16GB Ram so this bug has nothing to do with my Rig performance.

Back in the day **I was first asked and it was optional,** if I wanted a more secure account login. Now everyone gets bombarded and is **forced,** with e-mail verification logins and annoying captchas.

I'm literally being discriminated just because I change devices, locations and using a vpn.

At this point I personally don't even care anymore if you give us free games or fight for the right thing against apple.

The previous captcha was **OKAY;** it was solvable in approx. 10 - 20 seconds. Now I need to sit for at least 1 minute and let Jerry find his cheese.

And dear god, if the program decides to annoy me 10 of those pictures in a row, and I just make one error. All over again! And I even have to solve those when getting free games or buying games.

When I went to download it, one thing caught my eye. The download speed was between 400 and 900kb/s. And this brings up the question: WHAT THE HELL? I'm not going to compare download speeds with other clients like Steam or maybe Uplay, but I never get download times this low. To bring it to perspective, I usually get about 26-50mb/s in most cases. I assure you it's not my internet, as well.  Anyway, I went to sleep, thinking the game would be ready by the morning. 

It was at 16% when I went to sleep. Now it's at 80. 8 WHOLE HOURS passed by and this is still downloading. I don't know if this is in anyway my fault, because I barely even use this store, of if it's any setting I need to use, but it definetly shouldn't be.

This might sound entitled of my part like I ""got a free game and that's enough, I shouldn't complain"" or I'm ""being a choosing beggar"" but I think every developer and every ""gamer"" agrees that not taking ages to donwload a 36GB game should be the ideal experience.

And yes, I had nothing downloading in the background, internet connection via cable and a stable Wi-Fi connection (router just 50cm away from the PC). Only the store, downloading the game.

I don't even know what I expect from this post but it only goes to show why people only use this shit for free games. I heard it has something to do with downloading the game and installing it at the same time or something like that, I don't remember the details, and I'm not gonna rant about how shitty this store is, but you get the point. You guys really expected to compete with Steam with this?

This all started when I noticed emails from epic regarding changes to my account which involved authentication codes, password changes, linked accounts being connected/disconnected, and even payment methods being removed. Honestly that's probably good as they're not trying to charge to my account but I've already gotten plenty for fortnite and other games. Yet this person seems ultimately going after the fortnite account which would make sense since I've been playing since like season 1.

I've gone through so many different accounts and emails to change passwords and set up 2FA i can't count. Not knowing what all is compromised or how the hacker is getting in, sudden shocks of possible identity theft as an ultimate speculation. What's alarming is even epic's 2FA is getting bypassed. Then not even requiring 2FA for certain things to change account details. They can even bypass the player name change time frame as they've done it again and I know it wasn't available as it was recently reverted back.

This time around, I started receiving emails about an account that I know was connected to my epic account. Guess what emails come next? Yep, epic security codes, unlinked accounts, linked accounts, and etc. I race to start changing passwords and accessing my account back. Then I start getting emails from a person(hacker) stating that this is their account. Normally I wouldn't respond but the level of anger to then passive aggressive replies I received made me start uninstalling apps like the launcher itself as this person seemed to get in via the unreal engine side as they showed me a screenshot and somehow seemed to know what I was changing the password to. No viruses, or malware found and I ended up changing the credentials with a different device. They even tried getting into the different email I set the account to as they could even see that. 

Honestly this is still quite a battle and even now still a bit paranoid as to what level this hacker has intruded on my personal life and information. Still, they seem ultimately after my gaming account, but seriously. 

What would you do?

As you know, before rule #6 was put into place, the front page of the subreddit was filled with tech support questions. With suggestion from the community, it was decided that we'd have a separate mega thread for tech support or other related issues.  


Occasionally, we'd get complaints from users because of removing posts of some of the larger, more prominent issues regarding the store.  


So, we've decided to change up rule #6 a bit. Starting from today, **any store-wide issues that affect a lot of the users may have only one post up (usually the first one about the issue)**. The rest will be removed, and we'll redirect the users to that one specific post. We'll be trying this out for a while and depending on how it shapes up, we might amend it permanently into the subreddit rules.

I decided to cancel it, and went to go play. Then it froze, and closed the game, as if i closed it manually.

I did *not* hit the close, all i did was cancel the mod download. I then opened the game again, and the download was still there! I cancelled and downloaded one i saw on the FS subreddit, and it just said ""Pending"". I went back to the main menu, and voila, it closed itself. I reopened again, and the original ""pending"" download was gone, and behold! The map i didn't want was downloading once more!

1. Before you open your EGS make a backup of /%localappdata%/EpicGamesLauncher.

3. Paste the backup back

Maneater showing 22m on Galaxy while showing 28m on EGS, it's really annoying, almost like Galaxy doesn't track it)",Please add an option to open the Epic Games Launcher in the library and other annoyances I want Epic to fix,1.0,1598136155.0,2020-08-23 22:42:35

&gt; If you previously installed a game on your computer and removed the Epic Games Launcher or reinstalled Windows, **there is no feature in the Epic Games Launcher that will detect the game files.**

&gt; I recently updated my OS to Windows 10 as a clean install. In the new OS, I installed Epic Games Launcher to it's default directory on drive C, same location as it existed on Windows 7.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;When I logged in, my Library had all of the games greyed out as though they were not installed. But my previously installed games did still exist on drive D. This probably has to do with the new launcher install not having the manifest data that the old Windows 7 install had created over time.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;If you try to install (re-install) a game you know has already been installed, the EG Launcher will not let you install (or re-install) to a directory that already exists. It says ""Directory must be empty."", when you try to install to the original game directory.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Go to your Epic Games directory with Windows Explorer. It's usually C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games, unless you originally installed to a different location. Mine was on drive D.  
2. Find the game folder you want to reinstall (get working) and rename it. I just put an underscore in front of the original name. ex. \_ShadowComplexRemastered  
3. Start the install from the launcher. It will ask you to ""Choose install location"". Select the base Epic Games folder where your game files are already installed. ex. C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games. It will then show that path and add the game folder to the end. ex. C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\\ShadowComplexRemastered. Click Install.  
4. Let the Launcher download a couple MB's and ""Cancel"" the install, but leave open the launcher. Now you have a nearly empty brand new game folder in your Epic Games folder.  
5. Go back to Windows Explorer and rename the brand new folder to anything else. Then, go to the original folder you renamed and name it back to it's original name. You can delete the newer empty folder.  
6. Go to Launcher and click ""Resume"". The launcher will immediately Verify all files and you'll be ready to play.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Epic Games devs, it would be super helpful for users to have a ""Games Install Location"" on the launcher Settings page, so the launcher can automatically recognize files in a pre-existing directory and immediately verify them. 

instead of renaming and moving around files at step 5 above, use LinkShellExtension:  [https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#download](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html#download) and pick one of the existing library directory as link source, and drop as junction or symbolic link. (difference is junction is processed at server level so you can access it with ftp/smb/etc.)

Launcher might try to redownload game if verify fails for some reason, but no drive space is wasted here.

Tried changing the manifest and config files but seems like this is the easiest and foolproof way. (because you can't get the info needed anyways unless installation has been initiated)",How to detect existing installations of game,1.0,1598003317.0,2020-08-22 09:48:37

**We are a community run subreddit and have no affiliation with Epic. None of the moderators are from Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else please [email Epic Games customer support](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) and let them know.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/i4vijg/community_support_thread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[Solutions/Fixes Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

1597754437,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ic08mt/epic_vs_apple_why_doesnt_epic_offer_their_users/,"I've been following the fight between Epic and Apple and there's something that I don't understand.

Epic mainly supports the Microsoft and Apple platforms (a few more only for specific products). Similar platforms have a lot of power and because of that they can afford enforcing ""unfair"" terms of service. Epic, unhappy with Apple's terms of service, decided to start a fight over iOS. The situation is escalating and Epic might get kicked out of the whole Apple platform and suffer a big loss.

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly dislike Apple's terms of service, but the thing that I don't understand is: why doesn't Epic support more platforms, possibly independent and decentralized ones, where they don't have to report to anyone? They could just release their products, charge people directly and no company would ever be able to kick them out or charge them extra fees...

Steam is doing this, by supporting and pushing Linux, both directly, through Lutris and through SteamOS.

Epic Games only supports Windows and Mac OS. They're now putting up a fight against one of the two and accusing them of a being a monopoly. At the same time Epic is not supporting decentralized platforms (e.g. Linux, even though many games would support it and even though there's some demand) and forcing their users to choose between almost-monopolies only... I just don't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic (and anybody else developing any service or piece of software): if you're upset with an OS vendor because they're abusing their dominant position, the very first thing you should do is adding support to decentralized platforms and trying your best to steer your users to those.","Epic vs Apple: why doesn't Epic offer their users alternatives, if they're unhappy with the big platforms?",1.0,1597711237.0,2020-08-19 00:40:37

Epic does not have the same foot traffic that steam has.  When I play BL3, I play on epic because that’s the platform I bought.  I check out their store, I browse a bit.  

Ya know what happens when you don’t match the sales of competitors?  You lose customers, you lose foot traffic, you lose money - especially when it’s this big of a title you paid for an exclusive release for.   You invested a ton of $$$$ hoping it would pay off but what happened is that you had people just outright boycott the game.  You got the deal and then you fucked up and you’re letting more potential customers of not just this game but other games slip through your fingers.  

Because if I were to buy another game on epic - maybe it’s only on epic or maybe I recommend it on epic and I talk about it to other people - EXPONENTIAL SALES.  You just don’t get it though.  

I’ll probably get banned from this sub but that’s okay.",Epic games really dropped the ball with BL3.,1.0,1597519730.0,2020-08-16 19:28:50

I have not seen many people that do. I might be overreacting cause I don't even buy exclusive games and I have been waiting to buy control for a long time now  but I dislike the design and the way epic games makes games exclusive. I know this is pretty old news but I don't support the strategdy of making the games only on their platform and I never buy anything on the epic games store. Not just cause I dislike them but because steam I generally a better platform in my opinion.,Does anybody actually prefer the epic games over steam and use it for more than just exclusives and free games?

The charge was for $24.99 for the purchase of a 2500 +300 bonus V-Buck pack on my son's Epic Games account.  My son was out of state, with my wife and daughter visiting relatives with no access to the account.  I submitted a support ticket, and was refunded the money on 7 August 2020.  Fast-forward to 9 August 2020, my son gets home, and attempts to log into Fortnite so he could play with his friends.  Upon attempting to log in, he was met with an error message stating that his account was Inactive.  


He contacted Epic Games customer support via their ""Contact Us"" as they have no direct e-mails, no live-chat capability, and no customer support phone number.  A representative identified as ""Lima Victor"" asked him to verify information numerous times, which he did to the best that a 14-year old could, when asked to verify information that was at least two years old, to include locations of purchases, date account created, date accounts linked, last 4 of payment methods, et cetera.  ""Lima Victor"" then proceeded to tell him repeatedly that the information could not be verified, even when it was updated with more current/correct information.  


I then submitted a support ticket to attempt to assist him in this matter, and the representative identified as ""Alfa Tango"" told me that the account was permanently disabled due to suspicious spending on the account, and that he would need to create a new one.    


This account is at least two years old, so that's two years worth of achievements, progress, skins and hundreds of dollars spent to only be told in the politest way possible ""fuck you"" by the developer and that they would not be helping, despite the fact we identified suspicious activity and immediately reported it, in line with the Terms of Service.  This is a travesty, and my son is devastated because a developer decided that rather than help a customer, they would rather punish them for reporting suspicious activity on their own account.",Epic Games Punishes Players for Reporting Suspicious Activity on their Accounts,1.0,1597046744.0,2020-08-11 08:05:44

1596888667,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/i5y35l/help_please_lost_saved_files/,"Hello, i bought The withcer 3 on the epic games store, and played several hours the other day. Saved the game several times, could see the saved files in game, then turned the game off and my computer too. Next day when i try to open The witcher 3, the epic games launcher asks me if i want to save the save files on the cloud or systeme. I click on systeme as i always save on the system normally and i was never notified before where the game was being saved in the first place (yesterday and before). After chosing and launching the game i see no ""continue"" option and no way of checking if there is a save somewhere. I go to : documents/The Withcer 3/ gamesaves and nothing... Even more weird is that the epic Games launcher still registers the 8.44 hours played on the game but no saves to be found. If they are on the cloud but my game is not synchronised with the cloud anymore what do i do ? the saves must be somewhere.   
 So now with no notice from the Epic Games prior to today of where the saves where going, i was given an option i had no idea would impact my saves and it has lost my saves for nothing and with no warning... I would appreciate any feedback/help as i don't really want to waste hours doing stuff i have already done when it was lost with without me having a choice and no warning...   


I have screenshots showing the hour counter + the cloud sync + the empty gamesaves folder.",HELP PLEASE - Lost Saved Files,1.0,1596845467.0,2020-08-09 00:11:07

I don't download EVERY FREE GAME, but I have a 4 year old so I get games that she might like one day too. Like this week I could live without both games but I could also see my daughter liking them in a couple years. 

BUT...  I don't want to miss out on games like Troy TW. 

Anyone know how this works?

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hxn46w/community_support_thread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

1596714008,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/i4q8qn/what_i_want_to_see_from_epic_in_the_future_a_semi/,"Before I start I just want to say that English is my 3rd language and there may be many wording mistakes in here, it may also sound like a Steam appreciation post at times, but I figured it’s the best way I can compare and give new recommendations on what I want to see on Epic Games Store.

Greetings, I'm an avid EGS user, I've spent about 280€ on EGS in about 1.5 years of usage around 1 year of that being an ""active"" user, and 1.799€ on Steam in 7 years of usage, around 5 of those were ""active"" years. By active I mean years that I was on the store at least a few times a week.

I'm probably going to be comparing a lot of features to Steam's features, so sorry if you hate that, I just figured since it's the most popular store and also the store EGS is ""competing"" with, we should all look at that.

I've been using EGS a lot more than Steam recently, and I can say I like it, the sales and the coupons are awesome, I like the simplicity, I like the fact that it's curated. Definitely going to be used a lot more from me. I also recommended it to all my gaming friends.

But I do want to give some advice (?) on new things I'd like to see

1st of all, I want to talk about some updates that are coming in the future and are already confirmed

Social Overhaul (Semi-Long)

A better chat is definitely needed, EGS's chat is absolutely one of the worst I've ever seen. It's just an ugly ""block"" of nothingness: http://prntscr.com/tuorle compared to Steam's chat: http://prntscr.com/tuotq4 I know the difference is very small, but EGS's chat looks a lot more bland, and just ""depressing"" compared to Steam's chat, you also can't post emojis in it, which definitely isn't a big thing, but hey. You can't post files nor screenshots into the chat. I also want that chat windows stack (?) I don't want them to open individual windows eg: http://prntscr.com/tuowhh this REALLY NEEDS to be addressed and be made to something like Steam chat system: http://prntscr.com/tuoxux. The messaging also feels off (?) in Epic’s chat, almost like there’s like a delay when typing stuff fast, I don’t see it sometimes, but sometimes it’s really noticeable, like literally a 0.5 second delay. 

I can also talk about things like having group chat, the system that Steam has for that is also very good. But that, of course, isn't that important as refining general chat.

Voice chat, I would like it personally, but I mean, most of you use Discord anyways, but it's a nice thing to have regardless. Personally I never used much of Steam voice chat, but when I did, it never seemed to be worse than Teamspeak or Discord. This really isn't a ""needed"" feature, I'm just mentioning it, as having it really doesn't do harm.

I want the minimum size of the friend list window, to be smaller than it is This is the smallest size of EGS friend list vs Steam friend list:http://prntscr.com/tupnkp I don't want the friends list to take an unnecessary amount of space of my screen every time I open it (Right is EGS, Left is Steam) I also know this isn't a big or even a small thing for many of the people, but it’s just a very very small “cherry picked” thing, that I’ve noticed when playing games and just opening up friend list on both launchers the EGS one is just very bulky.



I could say many, many things about player-profiles, Steam probably has the best custom-profile selection (?) ever. It is true that you need to pay for the stuff to actually make your profile look ""good"" but 10€ is I think more than enough to customize it. I'm not going to go into this though, as Epic hasn't even implemented a feature like that for EGS, and it's kinda useless to go into depth with this as we haven't even seen Epic's version yet.

A new notification system could also be awesome, Steam has a very good system I guess, I know, again the word Steam, but it's literally the best store I can compare it to, and it's also the one it's competing with. I like the way you can control notifications, add sounds to notifications, disable the sounds yada-yada...

Groups would be nice to have, but are really pointless, custom groups made by the community, Steam has a very huge community for that, basically every Steam user is in at least 1 steam group, whether it’s their country steam group, eg. Germany - https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Deutschland-Germany Wheter it’s a Steam Group representing an esports organization: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Fnatic or a steam group representing their favorite dog breed, just tons of shit right. This is pretty “pointless” In the grand scheme of things I guess, and it’ll just make Epic Games Store more “bloated” which I know many here don’t like, but I’m just giving the idea out there.

There's more I could talk with social features, but it's just useless until it comes out, this are the main things that I'm looking at here, forums would also be good and stuff, but I mean, they really aren't necessary since there are already so many forums out there and also Reddit.

The reason I just typed all this, is basically, that I don't want to be disappointed with the Social Overhaul, we all know what happened with wishlists, we wanted them for a long time, they released them, I expected them to be at least the level of Steam wishlists, but the wishlist is very feature-less. I know NOT A BIG THING, MANY PEOPLE DON'T EVEN GIVE A DAMN. But still.

Let's just compare Steam wishlist vs Epic wishlist:

Epic's wishlist: You can sort by: items on sale, items recently added, Alphabetical, Price (Low to High, High to Low)

Steam wishlist: All that + Top Selling, Review score, Early Access, VR Only, Pre-Release, Which Operating System, Price (Less than 5€, Less than 10€, Less than Steam Wallet Balance) Discount (On sale, 50% or more, 75% or more) .
You can also rank games on Steam wishlist, as in the top game is your most wanted game, and the bottom game is your least wanted game. And look I get it, simplicity, Epic Games' wishlist does a very simple thing, wishlists your games, that's its job, and it does it well, but still, it's crazy how much more stuff Steam's wishlist has over Epic's wishlist, and a small thing like a damn WISH.LIST. I hope the same doesn’t happen with the Social Overhaul.


News Feed (Short)

The next future-development thing on the EGS is newsfeed, great, that's actually awesome! I love that, I actually checked the newsfeed on Steam and Epic very often, so this is great, I just hope it's good! Now, Steam's current newsfeed is decent at best, but they are actually reworking it, which I actually saw just now. This is the old one: https://store.steampowered.com/news/ as you see it's pretty out-dated looking, but it does it's job, it's kind of the same situation as with Epic Games wishlist. This is the new one: https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/ as you see, it looks much more modern and just better than the last one. this isn't actually a ""News Feed"" I mean it is, but they're turning it into a Steam News Hub, now I do not know what it actually means, but it seems to be more connected/more features (?).

I cannot talk about what I want to change with Epic's news feed, as it's just very basic, It does it's thing, but it's not that great nor that pretty to look at.  

What I want from the Improved Epic Games News Feed:
- Looking at Steam's new News Hub, it looks very good, way better than EGS current one, improve the look of it, news feed is supposed to look good and pleasurable to look at, the EGS news feed is fine, but it could look better.
- All the news are under the same place, that's just awful, looking at EGS news feed, it look incredibly cramped. The store news, the different game news, all under literally 1 place. Steam does this a lot better, you can sort by Steam Official news, Basically Steam updates, you can check Global Game news, this is top news from the biggest games on Steam. You can search by game news exclusively, there's a search bar that you can type in any game you want, and you can see that game's news feed, and you also have a ""Your News"" tab which is basically the news from all the games you own.
- Reminders, okay so Steam has this, developers can announce events on Steam's news hub, and you can set a reminder (Think, Twitter's reminders) you can set the reminder to send you notification via phone, via email or put it in your Google, Apple or Outlook calendar automatically, this is especially cool, if you're waiting for an update for a game, you can set a reminder and it reminds you through your email, phone, calendar or all of them at once, this would be a really cool addition to Epic Games news feed.

I can't say more than that, since Steam's news hub remake is still probably well off being released to the public as it's still in the experimenting phase, and Epic’s news feed is also being improved in the future, so we’ll see.

Now, I'm again sorry for doing this Steam vs EGS, but as I said, it's the best comparison I can do, I've tried to ignore it with each comparison, but I've just figured that comparing the two is the best advice I or anybody can give.

What I would like for Epic Games to implement:

A feature, which lets us test new features they are working on before they're released to the public
Again, Steam has a very good feature with that, it's called Steam Labs: https://store.steampowered.com/labs/ What does it do? It let's Steam Users which are in a Steam Group called Steam Labs test new Steam features the developers are working on, before they come out to the PUBLIC, it's crazy that Steam, a 16 year old store has this, but Epic Games Store, a 1.5 year old store, doesn't have that, it seems mandatory.

Better VR support, right now to play VR games on EGS, you need to launch an ANOTHER STORE/LAUNCHER for it to work, it can be the oculus VR launcher, or SteamVR. This is pretty self-explanatory.

Better library, this one is decent at best

We need better sorting, like we really do, especially as there’s just so many free games given out. Right now you can literally just sort it by alphabetical or recent, and filter it by all and installed. that is probably the most awful thing I’ve ever seen.

I’ll again do the Steam comparison, because believe it or not, it does library the best. Okay so Steam has all that plus: Filtering by genre example: Filter by Action, Racing, RPG, Strategy, Simulation etc. it has filtering by features example: Game includes Steam mod support, Achievements, Trading cards…..  It has filtering by Hardware support example: Controller (Parital, Full) VR. And it has filtering by players example: Single-Player….. You can also filter by store tags, store tags are tags that players give games to describe them, this is not associated with the genre example: filter by: Masterpiece, Female protagonist, remake, remastered, cinematic, for that to work Epic would first need to add store tags, but I don’t see that happening, and like a BUNCH of other shit, but Steam probably has that because there’s just so many games.

I want to be able to group the games under a single category, steam has this feature called “Collections” it lets you make a collection, name it for example “Battle Royale” or “My games I play while eating cheese sticks” and you can add games to those 2 collections, this really improves organizing.

There is also a mini news feed on top of the home part of the library where you can see the news of your games, again, a nice feature, but some may not like it due to it making EGS more bloated.

Steam’s library game pages also have a lot more stuff to look at, for example, when you click on a game in your library you own, you can see that game’s community hub, you can see the screenshots player have taken in that game and uploaded them (also one feature that EGS really needs, screenshots) you can see the game’s developers, the release date, guides, you can go to the game’s forums, to the game’s store page, you can look at all the friends that own that game, the recent updates and more ALL from the library. I would love something like this in Epic Games Library, as the current one really doesn’t show anything, there’s just a launch the game button, and view store page button, and I know many of you love it like that, but I’ll bet a lot of people would like more features in the library.

Better Linux support, currently there’s no Linux support on EGS, and the Linux community is furious.

More store things like recommendations based on the games you played, a curator feature would also be nice, but not really needed.

An UI made just for controllers, think Big Picture mode for Steam.

This is basically it, this are the big things I want to come in the next 3 years.

When a game reaches 72 hours played, they changed hours to ""days played"", so it would just show as ""3d"", and anything past that would be hidden until you reached 4 days. 

[Example](https://i.imgur.com/vJ5mvc7.jpg)

Not only did Epic grant this request, they now show time played down to minutes and seconds for all games!

After googling the issue, I found out that a lot of people have this issue. Sometimes it fixed itself, others have weird solutions or redownload everything but most of the time this doesn't work at all.

I've yet to find a fix for this, I'm still palying the game without DLCs.

&amp;#x200B;

What issues I ran into in the two years of using Epic launcher every now and then:

Red Dead Redemption 2: The game downloaded twice and its about 100GB. Since there is no download limiter, I couldn't do anything internet related for two days.

Borderlands 3: My characters got deleted and resetted until I stopped playing because of this.

GTA 5: The Epic Store tries to connect to the rocketgames launcher or something, but it usually ends in a timeout from the epic store, 10 seconds before the Rocketgames launcher starts so the game just crashes.

Metro Exodus: When there is a new update to download, it seems like it downloads the whole game again. Additionally to that, my savegame files got resetted once.

The launcher crashes every two or three days.

Not enough details. I can't even see if I have the Anno 1800 DLCs. I had to check my payment history to find out that the purchase really worked.

For an entire month since the last major NVidia Game Ready driver update I'm effectively blocked from accessing my paid games by the launcher issue.
For a first couple if weeks I received only various automated responses, every single one was dumb in its own unique way. Then was a week of silence. Last week it seems like a live person answering me, but no new ideas or solutions except to downgrade my driver and live with it. 
Is there anybody out there who cares for the customer in a  need of help?
Or maybe some workaround to get access to my games without that nightmarish launcher?

I have looked for a solution for hours and found nothing, but I have finally figured it out and decided to make this post to help anyone else with the issue.    


For me the issue was that something called vJoy Device in Game Controller settings had a constant Up and it the left input, I have no idea what this Vjoy Device is but here is the fix.  


\- Search ""vjoy"" in the search bar in windows. 

\- Click ""Configure vJoy""

\- Untick all of the axes ""X, Y, Z, RX, etc.""

\-Click apply and restart your PC.

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it, I have no Idea what caused this but I was unable to play most of my games because of this, I hope this helps others with the similar issue.",Fix for games being unplayable due to camera looking up and spinning,1.0,1595857180.0,2020-07-28 13:39:40

**We are a community run subreddit and have no affiliation with Epic. None of the moderators are from Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else please [email Epic Games customer support](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) and let them know.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hor15t/community_support_thread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[Solutions/Fixes Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

Does anyone seriously use epic to message friends? I mean the chat is not really that good either.
Epic should stop buying their customers, but instead do something so the customers come to them.
Buying games on the other big platform (except for offline games without a modding community) is the much smarter choice for now, even if you had to pay 5$ more. I just can't see anyone seriously using this platform as of now.

Should be an obvious guess here, [Paragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvMom-AgLsU). As someone who joined right after the game had left legacy behind. I watched it grow into one of the only games i can genuinely say *I have lost sleep on because it was so good.* I remember being late to work the next day because I had to that one last match knowing it (and it's community) was being tossed to the wind in the coming hours.

It was clear that the developers poured their heart out into this game and it's a shame it's a thing of the past now. Getting back on topic now. If they had an IP like Paragon, their business model of acquiring exclusives would ***make sense***. They got rid of the only thing that was keeping me on the platform, and that's coming from someone who is Pro-Steam.

Even if they would have put a Temporary halt on Paragon, the game would go hand in hand for their exclusive strategy; offering more than a few unique in-house games on their platform, making me want to use it for more than the free games they occasionally put out.

Thanks for reading!

After about a week, another support person put both games into my account, they said they can't give epic coupons (I asked for it so I can repurchase).

The first person that responded to me might have trouble with English I'm guessing, he/she owned up to the mistake on our convos.

Three work-arounds:

Reboot will allow one launch.

Launch another epic-game-store title that uses social panel and get into the renderer proper (not menus: MW5 mercs Instant action, launch a mission, exit). Allows one launch.

Disable the overlay by moving all **EOS\*.\*** in the folder {install drive&amp;directory}**\\Epic Games\\Launcher\\Portal\\Extras\\Overlay** to a subfolder (such as **\\\_disabled**. ""Fixes"" the problem.

This is the only game that I personally have which exhibits this problem. Have tested with onther games, including Metro Exodus DX12. MW5Mercs is the only title I have that can resolve the issue.

*The Epic Games launcher stores information about the games you have installed in manifest files. These are kept in* *C:\\ProgramData\\Epic\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Data\\Manifests*  
 *and* *C:\\ProgramData\\Epic\\UnrealEngineLauncher*  
*. You can edit these manifests to change where the launcher looks for the game. Here’s how to do it:*

1. *Exit the Epic Games Launcher. Check you didn’t just send it to the tray.*
2. *In Explorer, go to* *C:\\ProgramData\\Epic\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Data\\Manifests*  
 *and open all of the .item files in a text editor (e.g. Notepad) until you find the one for the game you want to move.*
3. *Move the files from wherever you installed the game to the new drive or directory.*
4. *Modify the* *ManifestLocation*  
*,* *InstallLocation*  
*, and* *StagingLocation*  
 *values in the manifest to point to the new install directory.*
5. *Save the manifest.*
6. *Open* *C:\\ProgramData\\Epic\\UnrealEngineLauncher\\LauncherInstalled.dat*  
 *in a text editor (e.g. Notepad) and change the* *InstallLocation*  
 *value for your game to point to the new install directory.*
7. *Save* *LauncherInstalled.dat*
8. *Open the Epic Games Launcher again.*

*Your game should show as ready to launch. If it shows as “Repair” then you either forgot to exit the launcher (just restart it and the error will go away) or you did something wrong when you edited the manifest files.*",Moving Epic store games From one drive to another,0.88,1594703778.0,2020-07-15 05:16:18

1594460881,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hp7fbr/epic_games_store_database_website_epicdatainfo_is/,"[EpicData.info](https://EpicData.info) is a database website of Epic Games Store similar to SteamDB for Steam. Recently updated with some useful features so I thought it would be good to share it here in case someone interested for such database tool. Simply this is the website were people get to know what's the next free games during EGS Holiday Sale's 12 days of free games promotion last year. So if a studio going to add its game to the store then it's the first place that will be appear before it went to the live store.

Recently it got price history tracking feature and now it has [Promotional](https://epicdata.info/promotions) tab which lets you to check what games are currently on sale in entire Epic Store catalog. As you may know Epic Store currently doesn't has any filter or section to let you check discounted games all in one place so that would be useful alternative until Epic implement similar filtering feature or 'On Sale' section.

If you want to check the price history for a certain game;

\&gt; Click on New Games tab,

\&gt; Type name of the game you want on search bar at right top corner,

\&gt; Click on the game row, try to avoid clicking on any highlighted hyperlinks on the row,

\&gt; Scroll down on the newly opened page until you see Price History graph,

\&gt; US Dollar is default, if you looking for certain currency other than US Dollar then first click on USD tag then select the tag of what currency you're looking for.

\&gt; If the game you're looking doesn't have price history then it might be hard to notice the base price at first glance. There should be a circular dot sitting on the side of 'value'. Hover over that dot to see the price along with date stamp.

**Ps:** Price history feature is recently implemented to the website frontend so unfortunately you can not see price changes for a game on latest Mega Sale for example. But since it's fetching all price data from now on it will be more useful in time.

**Tip:** You can change the currency on promotional tab as well. US Dollar is set to default but you can change it by clicking on the dropdown menu where it says 'US' right under EpicData button on top left corner. 

**Personal note:** Keep in mind it's not yet feature rich as SteamDB since Epic Store is also lacks on plenty of features and such database can only read what's available on store database to fetch. It can't offer something that if Epic intentionally restrict or it's not available in the first place. Hope this post will help out for other database enthusiasts.",Epic Games Store database website EpicData.info is now reworked with new look and additional features,1.0,1594417681.0,2020-07-11 21:48:01

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hc2oz8/community_support_thread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

Even right clicking Epic Games on the task bar takes a while compared to other programs, I mean right clicking it so you can close it, in other words the spot next to the time. Even Epic Games uses way more of my computer than Steam. I only have 8GBs of RAM, and Epic uses 148.2MB's of that, compared to Steams 46.0MB's. Epic Games also uses 10-11 percent of my CPU, which is a lot actually, compared to Steams ZERO percent! Even with Steam's fancy new look it performs way better than Epic Games.

I'll let you know my tale about my account which was compromised, to let you know, it was so frustrating!
One day, i've logged into my account but password was wrong, i had to fix this immediately. Well, so i've pressed forgot password, and waited for an e-mail, but there was no e-mail arriving from Epic Games about password reset instructions. And as i didn't know about Epic Games Support and their possible account recovery, i started all over!
I've deleted all the previous e-mails from Epic Games(purchase receipts, verification codes and linking), then it was like 1 year later, i contacted Epic Games Support, with almost all requiered details to provide! So, i could provide them account creation date, IP address, previous external accounts(i had only PSN connected before), original display name, location where purchases were made, last 4 digits of the first payment card! As i've provided almost everything except of any purchase recepit or InVoice ID, because i've deleted them a way before, they said that they are not able to verify my ownership. Then i've responded that if it isn't enough to verify my ownership and they said that without the very first payment/purchase receipt, they will not be able to verify my account's ownership. That was so frustrating, but i remembered that my very first purchases were all made on PlayStation, so they must be on my PSN account! I've asked if it would be okey(it had to be, because it was the original proof) and i've provided them the screenshot of the PSN order receipt from PSN portal. They finally verified me and changed the e-mail address to mine, also changed account's holder name and region, i was so happy to see all my stuff after an entire year!
Well, now i have my two Epic Games accounts and if anyone needs to help with account recovery, do not hesitate to contact me, i'm here to help you :)",My compromised account tale!,1.0,1594088563.0,2020-07-08 02:22:43

1593834984,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hkwyim/have_you_ever_noticed_how_the_egs_detractors_will/,"For some examples:

- They'll take a the few amount of people that ask about free games on game announcements, for example Epic announces a game for the store, and some of the replies to the tweet are asking about Conan, or asking if the newly announced game is going to be free.  They turn that asking questions thing into some kind of huge deal.  One quote

&gt;This is the kind of community they've been building for themselves over the last 18 months. They do nothing but shoot themselves in the foot, then instead of admitting fault and improving anything, they just dig their head intot the sand and keep shooting while shouting that it doesn't hurt.

They seem to ignore the kind of remarks gamers make during Steam sale events, there are always a ton of thread complaining about the Steam sale discounts on Steam forums, yet we don't see people making statements about the kind of community Valve has created through their sale events.

- Or their biggest one ""It devalues games, people will just wait for it to be free instead of paying full price for it""... yet where were these people on Steam deep discount sales?  How many years have we seen people talk about how they don't buy games at full price because they know it will be at a deep discount probably with in the first 12-18 months anyways.  I believe r/patientgamers was in part based on this concept.

Those are the 2 biggest ones, there are more.

But it really seems like these people are doing their hardest to make it look like everything Epic does for the store is a bad thing.  They even attack the $10 coupons on a regular basis for ridiculous reasons.

These people complain about how Epic isn't trying to compete, isn't helping to make prices lower, but then they complain about free games and $10 coupons, they are literally complaining about the very thing they want to see competition do for the industry.

We are literally getting free games and cheaper games literally due to a store is actually wanting to compete against Steam for once, something we have never seen in this industry.",Have you ever noticed how the EGS detractors will create any reason to show Epic giving out free games is a bad thing?,0.6,1593791784.0,2020-07-04 15:56:24

&amp;#x200B;

When I try to start GTA V, this error shows up saying the path doesn't exist when it clearly does. Pressing 'ok' it suggests verifying the game files. Verifying the game files took some time but completed without an error. It didn't fix anything, the error still shows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell me how I can resolve this. I don't want to reinstall the whole game.

&amp;#x200B;

Also. Previously, I couldn't run the Epic Games app, it said invalid drive D. So, I did ""subst D: C:\\"" in the command prompt. This solved the problem to the Epic Games app.

So they released a new blog today, they do this every month talking about what they are working on and what is coming up.  The game has gone through a significant amount of transformation since release. Despite the original developers ""closing up shop"" only to immediatly re-open as a studio owned by Bethesda, the publishers of the game were not going to give up on it, they are suing Human Head Studios, were able to get the source code and assets, and they created a new studio called Studio 369 to work on Rune 2.

Studio 369 has been doing an excellent job of bringing this game out of the ashses.  They got the core game play mechanics in a great postion, and now they are working on changing up the gameplay loop, rewriting the storyline, recording new voice overs, and so much more.

Going by the lawsuit complaint, they did receive money up front from Epic games when it was determined that the game needed a lot more work before release and they really needed the money for it.  I am wondering if any of this, the great post release work,  would have been possible if they never made the exclusive deal with Epic?","Epic Exclusive RUNE II Monthly Update blog — June 2020 and a little bit about it being like a ""phoenix"" and the new developer studio",1.0,1593616636.0,2020-07-02 15:17:16

Anyway Fez is really nice platforming/puzzle game. The platformic aspects of it are easy - it does not require incredibly precise inputs like Meatboy, Hollow Knight or Ori. It makes it really enjoyable for casual players and the ones that do not like getting frustrated while playing.

Now for the puzzle aspects... WOW. There are multiple puzzles: from basic ""change perspective"", through some more advanced ones like ""listen to which speaker is making noise and do a thing"" to very advanced ones that involve specially created language and numeric system. And honestly I wouldn't get most of them if it weren't for the online guides.

Anyway the game can be completed without getting into the harder puzzles, they are only required for 200+% completion and ""perfect ending"" of sorts.",Fez is really great platforming/puzzle game.,1.0,1593585180.0,2020-07-02 06:33:00

Sorry if this is a stupid question but I cannot seem to find the answer I am looking for.

I claimed the Borderlands: Handsome Collection when it was given away not too long ago. I recently noticed that the Handsome Collection is supposed to come with a whole bunch of dlc for at least Borderlands 2. However when I try to see what dlc I own for the game, all I see is the HD texture back and when I go to the store page for Borderlands 2 the only dlc I see listed is the ""Commander Lilith &amp; the Fight for Sanctuary"" as coming soon. Is it just a matter of Epic not having all the dlc yet and it will be available to owners of the game whenever the Epic store gets them?

I am wondering because when I look at the handsome collection on steam it has a whole bunch of dlc included.

Thank you for reading and I look forward to seeing what you all say!",Does Borderlands: Handsome Collection include all the dlc on Epic?,0.72,1593402868.0,2020-06-30 03:54:28

1593200450,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hgegds/epic_won_me_over/,"Few months ago: I didn't care about the newest outrage:  ""Steam vs Epic"". Of course every comment that was in favor of epic was downvoted to hell and in favor of steam upvoted - typical reddit echo chamber, not surprising.

It was a bit cringe though how people acted and still act like we are in a action movie, where everything is black and white - steam the good guys / epic the bad guys.

In my eyes both are grey, like nearly everyone and everything in life actually

Weren't interested in taking any sides, both are companies that just want my money in the end, so I choose whats most beneficial for me, not for the company

At the time that was steam - I had all my games that I accumulated over the years there, a lot of money already invested in my collection.

Then I noticed the free games, which I saw as really nice move of EPIC, super beneficial to the consumer (me) - great games even, not those trash 50 cent indie games that are always given away on other sites, so it looks like they are generous, but in reality they give you the biggest shittiest trash available.

No - it were mostly highly rated good games.

Always grabbed them but thought ""I will probably only use EPIC to play those free games every now and then, still going to continue to buy and build my collection on steam"" - because well like I said most of my collection was already there and I didn't see a reason to move

...And then they started with the 10€ coupons and won me over, I bought multiple games at insane prices... like I am not overreacting - with the 10€ coupon + the running sale you could get games for the lowest price ever recorded for those games, on any store. Not rarely even cheaper than black market keys

I bought like around 100€ worth of games and now Steam and EPIC are equals in my book, I am now going to build my game collection on both EQUALLY, where-ever its cheaper.

EPIC still has a lot to improve upon, but I really like how they didn't just wedge themselves into the market, but also really reward the consumer for buying and staying with them

&amp;#x200B;

""They don't care about you!! They are just doing it for the marketing!! To win you over!!!"" - yeah no shit, like I said at the beginning, EPIC and Steam are both companies that don't give much real shits about anyone of you or me.

Yet I am profiting of their marketing.

I don't give a fuck about the INTENTION of their action, I give a fuck about the RESULT of their action which is FREE GAMES + insane deals and prices

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I think a lot of you will see yourself in that story. How you first thought you would always stay at steam, but epic just kept churning out awesome things until they ""won you over"" and you started to buy games from them

EPIC and Steam are both good and bad - competition like that will in most cases profit us, the consumer. Because one thing is certain: Steam had it too cozy in the past.",EPIC won me over,0.92,1593157250.0,2020-06-27 07:40:50

1593189161,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hgavmt/i_wrote_an_opinion_piece_on_the_epic_games_store/,"Ever since Epic Games launched their very own storefront at the end of 2018 there has been a vocal opposition within the gaming community. A multitude of different justifications have been put forward for this – the fact that the store does not offer user reviews, the aggressive poaching of new releases for Epic exclusivity, and sought after features that consumers had become accustomed to not being present at launch, to name but a few – however, what has fascinated me has been the sheer intensity of the voices that object to its presence. It does not strike me as a problem that is merely down to a preference for Steam as a storefront, but instead points at perhaps a more emotive issue for gamers.

The problem with the Epic Games Store, I believe, is not anything inherently wrong with the Epic Games Store itself but instead arises as a result of the uncertainty that is present with digital ownership. From a legal standpoint, purchasing a game digitally in most countries does not give someone ownership of the game itself but, instead, offers them the right to access the licence of said game. This is a somewhat troubling position for those who have invested a significant amount of money and time into building a library of games on a single storefront. Steam has long been the go-to storefront – for many, the only storefront – for those wishing to purchase games and arguably the Epic Games Store is the first substantial threat to Steam’s utter dominance within the market.

Quite rightly, there are those that may be apprehensive about the idea of there being a viable competitor on the market, as that competition brings along with it risk. What if the Epic Games Store were to surpass Steam in the near to distant future? What if, god forbid, Steam were ever faced with financial difficulty or made a conscious decision to go in a different direction as a business? There is no definitive answer to the question of what would happen to their purchases should this happen. Consumers within the video game industry are arguably best positioned to be aware that digital ownership is, at present, a mere illusion of ownership. Whilst those who purchase albums, books or films digitally may not fully appreciate the frailty of their access to their digital goods many gamers have faced the brunt of licencing issues (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World), disputes that have occurred internally within a company (P.T), and even political issues (Devotion) playing a role in a game becoming inaccessible.

Ultimately, however, competition inevitably benefits the consumer in the long run. The Epic Games Store being a viable alternative to Steam places pressure on Steam to adapt, improvise and improve their service for both consumers and developers. You do not need to look very far to see some of the benefits that have arisen since the Epic Games Stores launch. Over $2,000+ of free games have been offered to consumers as of May 2020 and developers have taken home more of the profits generated from their game as the percentage taken by Epic’s storefront is magnitudes smaller than the cut taken by Steam (12 percent as opposed to 30 percent). The complacency that Steam has often faced criticism for in the past is no longer an option. They must fight for their position in the market and, even for those willing to die on Steam’s hill, that is a good thing as it fosters innovation.

Whilst this is an issue that has been particularly prevalent on PC it is not one that is exclusive to the platform. With Xbox releasing an all-digital version of the Xbox One S in 2019 and the Playstation 5 reveal showcasing that there will be a digital only offering on launch the consumers position in regards to digital ownership is only going to become more important. Subscription services such as Game Pass and PS Now may render this issue irrelevant by the end of the decade. It is not hard to see the influence that subscription services such as Spotify and Netflix has had on ownership, both physical and digital, in their respective mediums – however, for the time being, the uncertainty that digital ownership brings is an issue that deserves more attention – and I believe that, at least to some degree, the aversion to the Epic Games Store has been somewhat influenced by this problem.",I wrote an opinion piece on the Epic Games Store and why the nature of digital ownership may be the reason some are apprehensive to use it,0.85,1593145961.0,2020-06-27 04:32:41

I dont know if the devs look at this subreddit, and I don't know for sure if  the devs will actually read this, but if you are a dev or have contact with a dev, please read this.

Back in December of 2019, the epic games store released the escapists for free. Most people reported  that the game wouldn't even start, me included. There were some solutions online, but only one (kind of) worked for me, and even then it was a 1/10 chance the game would actually load. 

The epic games official twitter said that they were looking into the problem, and on a steam page a team 17 dev asked that they send info about what was happening, so the devs know about the problem. I left the issue, thinking that the devs would fix it soon.

It's been 6 months, and there isn't an official fix.

I just spent half an hour trying to start the damn game. I WANT to play this game, but I can't. The game is great, and it would be awesome if I could actually, yknow, play it.

If I get a game from a storefront, I expect to be able to play it.

So PLEASE, devs, fix the epic games release. Thanks for reading. :)","Dear Team 17 / Mouldy Toof studios, PLEASE fix your EGS release of The Escapists!",1.0,1592949462.0,2020-06-24 21:57:42

My Epic Games Store was minimized to the system tray where it usually sits while I'm using my computer for other things. I pulled it up from the system tray hoping to play and relieve some stress. Much to my chagrin, it seems as though I cannot log into the Epic Games Store.   


The status on the bottom left of the Epic Games Store UI says ""Offline."" At first I thought it was no big deal, so I clicked the status and pressed ""Sign In."" It brought me to the sign in screen, so I sign in. I go through the Arkose Labs CAPTCHA requirement. Everything seemed fine. I see the loading screen and under it says ""Welcome, \[user\]."" I had seemingly been logged back in.  


I glance at the status hoping to see my username, but, instead, I see ""Offline."" No worries, I tell myself. I sign in again and once I finish the whole process... ""Offline."" I do it again... ""Offline."" Again.. ""Offline."" Now I start getting worried. I try deleting the webcache folder in the EpicGamesLauncher localappdata folder. I go through the process again... ""Offline."" I restart my computer... ""Offline""  


I've tried what I can and what searching I have done online has been completely fruitless as I see no mention of this problem anywhere at all. Is there any way this could be fixed?  


My biggest worry about this bug is that I will stop receiving updates to my games barring me from playing my multiplayer games. I would still like to play my multiplayer games as I have spent money on them, so please, a solution would be much appreciated.  
Notes

* I can launch games. When I launch Dauntless, I am logged in, and I can play oddly enough.  

* When the store initially opens after I ""Sign in"", I receive a notification about the number of friend requests I have, but when the UI of Epic Games Store actually loads in, my status is ""Offline"" and there is no ""Friends"" tab to be seen anywhere.
* When I click the ""Home"" tab, there is a blue ""Sign In"" button on the top right and an ""ACCOUNT SAFETY"" message about verifying my email (I have already verified my email though).
* The games in my library that were not installed but were being downloaded now say ""Uninstall.""  

* If I click on the ""Unreal Engine"" tab, the UI returns to normal and it correctly displays that I am signed in, but once I click anything else, it reverts to ""Offline.""",Epic Games Store Status is Offline,1.0,1592790793.0,2020-06-23 01:53:13

1592778749,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/hdg114/how_to_symlink_steam_installations_of_games_to/,"**what is a symlink?** 

symlink stands for symbolic link. basically another name for the same file

**why do i want symlinks?**

if you have two installations of a game (say you had trouble joining your friend's game from his epic installation on your steam installation of a free game from epic, so you got the epic version too) and you dont want to use twice the disk space for the same game, a symlink will allow you to only have one copy of the files but use both installations - saving you data from the download and disk space from the lack of duplicate files

**how do i make symlinks?**

the bold is the commands you use, but with my folders, using ark as an example.  you'll do the same thing but with your folder names. Start the epic installation of the game, pause it, then exit epic games. take note of the folder name that epic created to install, then rename it to anything. open a command prompt as administrator.

type the name of the drive your games are installed on, if its not C:

**D:**

change directories to the folder you renamed at the beginning

**cd D:\\Epic Games\\ARKSurvivalEvolvedrenamed**(whatever you renamed it to)

change directories to the parent folder of the one you installed

**cd ..**

make the symlink, using mklink /j \*original name of the folder epic created\* ""\*path to the steam installation of the game\*""

**mklink /J ArkSurvivalEvolved ""D:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\ARK""**

And thats it! then just open epic games and resume installation and it will verify the existing files from your steam installation instead of downloading them again.",How to symlink steam installations of games to the epic store version so you dont have to download twice - quick guide,0.89,1592735549.0,2020-06-22 10:32:29

what i'm trying to say here is that these games probably were only brought to EGS because epic, ea and disney probably agreed on a fortnite promotion. it happened with jedi fallen order where if you buy the game on epic you get the stormtrooper fortnite outfit with it and i bet their will be a collab between fortnite and squadrons

Epic have been doing deals with disney for 3 years now, mainly in the marvel departement, but also in the star wars departement. and these games probably only exist on the store because of these collabs. which explains why all of the other ea games aren't coming to epic

all i'm trying to say is that you shouldn't expect ea games to come to EGS because some did. those are particularly special.

Now this doesn't mean ea games will never come to epic. they did state that they are exploring other storefronts. and i suspect that the deal with valve doesn't say that they shouldn't put these games on competing storefronts as clearly those 2 games did come out on EGS. it's just that its probably not happening soon

And let's be real, if EGS continues its fast growth in terms of marketshare and playerbase. sooner or later publishers will have to put their games on it. but for now don't go expecting fifa or madden or whatever to go on EGS

OH.. also as a happy side note, epic has been doing deals with warner bros for quite some time now ( free batman games, batman;joker; aquaman in fortnite ), so you should probably expect the next batman game to come to EGS

Conclusion: I just saw a lot of people expecting ea games to come to EGS because some did and just wanted to explain why that's probably not happening anytime soon",EA Games on EGS,0.72,1592542730.0,2020-06-20 04:58:50

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous Community Support Thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/h10rbf/community_support_thread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

And today it happened again last night it was around 25% and when I woke up it said something about Epic Store got disconnected and I needed to sign in again when I resumed the download it starts from 0 with the 45GB file. I'm not sure if it's a problem with my internet or what but it seems very specific that the download restarts around the same time always and I don't have a problem with the launcher disconnecting any other times except with this game and only when it's around 25%.  
The files are there I don't know why the launcher isn't recognizing them when I click resume.

The problem is when I go to launch Ark my screen flickers once and that’s it. No Ark menu, don’t see any processes in activity monitor related to Ark, yet Epic Games Launcher says it’s running.

I went ahead and validated the install after a restart of my Mac and nothing. I tried to use the DX10 low graphics mode (even though my iMac is a 2019 model) and still nothing.

I was wondering of it was possible to open the same epic games account on 2 separate computer at the same time. I only use Epic Games account for the unreal engine 4 and it library and stuff, in the same time I aslo got some games but I don't play that much anymore. Anyway my brohter just got his vacation and thought maybe he would have fun wasting some time playing these games, as he can't get out anyway due to the whole quarantine thing. So I thought if it was possible for him to use my epic account to play the games while I work on UE4, and I need to be online for that as I usually get assets from the store and download stuff and so on so forth. So I am asking if it's possible to do that.

1592023060,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/h80ns2/far_cry_3_deluxe_edition_and_activating_your/,"Scroll down for TLDR

I bought the Far Cry 5 Gold Edition on the Epic Games Store. I downloaded and activated it the first day. No problem. But I could not find the Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition that was supposed to be included.

So I searched the internet and found all the issues people were having. Mostly I found people being told to wait for 7 days for Epic to manually add the entitlement to their Epic Games library. I did find a few other non-solutions: People told it's Ubisoft's fault, no, it's Epic's fault, no the Far Cry 3 on the Epic store or in the Far Cry 5 Season Pass on Epic is different, blah blah blah yadda yadda yadda. Too much shoulder shrugging and passing the buck instead of just helping customers with their purchased product.

7 days to activate a digital purchase is ridiculous.

So I waited. I checked each day. Nothing. On the 7th day I was about to open a support ticket and looked on the Epic Store page for Far Cry 3. And there it said ""unavailable"" and Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition said owned. Great. So I start the Epic launcher. There's Far Cry 3. Start the install. Nope, get an error message, unavailable or something. Fine. Quit the Epic launcher. Quit uPlay. Close my browsers. Try again. This time it starts. Goes through the activation process on uPlay. Check uPlay. There it is, Far Cry 3 Deluxe. I think I checked My Games under account information and the game was listed there but there was no key or hide or show key prompts. Go back to the Epic launcher. Install Far Cry 3. Download finishes. Game is installed. Start the game. It switches over to uPlay. Another update. More steps to install. Finally, the game starts.

So the first thing I want to see is the Deluxe Edition content. Supposed to have some tattoos on my arms. Be able to get a unique melee weapon in the stores inside the game. Other special weapons and extra missions on the map. I can't find them. Maybe I need to play a little. I do the first radio tower mission. Nothing. I do the first outpost mission. Nothing.

Here's the link to Ubisoft's description of the content: [https://support.ubisoft.com/en-us/Faqs/000035395/Contents-of-Far-Cry-3-Deluxe-Editon-FC3](https://support.ubisoft.com/en-us/Faqs/000035395/Contents-of-Far-Cry-3-Deluxe-Editon-FC3). If you go in the game and bring up the map there should be some extra icons for The Lost Expedition missions and Monkey Business. If I recall, one at the top of the map, one at the bottom, and one on the right side. If you don't see these missions on the map then your deluxe content is not activated.

I recheck the Epic Store. Says Far Cry 3 owned. Says Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition owned.

So I've got Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition but I don't seem to have the deluxe contents inside the game.

So I search the internet again. Some say, oh, just quit and restart a few times and it will appear. Some solutions for Steam. And a couple of times they say enter your key in the menu in the game.

So I go into uPlay. I go to my Account Information and go to My Games. Scroll to Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition. It has a Show key prompt. So I show the key and I record it. I start Far Cry 3. In the Far Cry 3 menu I go to Options and then Downloadable Content. I enter the key I previously recorded and I'm rewarded with ""Congratulations on unlocking the collector's edition content"" or something like that. I check the store in game for the extra melee weapon and other weapons. They are all there. I look at the characters arms (get in vehicle to see them, they are small marks) and there they are. I check the map. Extra missions for Lost Expedition and a monkey.

And that's how I got my Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition that was included with my Far Cry 5 Gold Edition.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

* Epic can take 7 days to give you Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition if you buy Far Cry 5 Gold Edition or the Far Cry 5 Season Pass.
* After activating and installing Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition your deluxe edition content may be missing in game. 
* Check for extra ""Lost Expedition"" missions in the game map.
* If they are missing, you content is not activated. If they are there, you don't need to do anything.

If your Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition content is missing:

* Find the key in uPlay for your Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition under Account Information and then My Games. Record this key.
* Start Far Cry 3 and go to Options and then Downloadable Content in the game's menu and enter the previously recorded key. You must be online and connected to uPlay for this to work.
* You should get a congratulations on activating your collector's edition content.
* Check your map in the game and there should be some new missions (The Lost Expedition and Monkey Business).",Far Cry 3 Deluxe Edition and activating your missing deluxe edition content,0.75,1591979860.0,2020-06-13 16:37:40

I still remember bitching when I was forced to DL it to play Empire TW. Its grown on me though. The sales, the workshop and review system are all top notch. 

I didnt know much about Epic until the Batman series was free. What a score! But I uninstalled. As they continue to give us great games I've grown more appreciative to the point that I bought a game. Now Ark is free the type of game I've been interested in but wouldnt buy because my video game funds are limited. 

Basically all of that to say thank you Epic. Your strategy is working. Keep being generous, it's hard to get us to play less on steam. But over time it can happen. Freshen up the UI some, get an inhouse review system and same for mods. Cheers!","Epic games has won itself an fan, more importantly an active player.

**We are a community run subreddit and have no affiliation with Epic. None of the moderators are from Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else please [email Epic Games customer support](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) and let them know.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Welcome to the Community Support Thread**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Support Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issue posts which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

[You can find the previous thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gs7rxv/tech_support_megathread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[Solutions/Fixes Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

\### Do not reply below this line ###Epic Games Player SupportJune 08, 2020, 14:23 +0000 | Conversation ID: #33314501Hello there,

I see that another agent had escalated your ticket to a higher level of support and your case has made its way to me. My name is India November and it's a great pleasure to meet you.

First of all, I would like to apologize for the delay in my response. We are currently dealing with the huge volume of tickets and are working hard to handle them in a timely manner. Thank you for your understanding regarding this!

I understand that you have purchased the Far Cry 5 Gold Edition which includes the Season Pass and you have expected to receive the Deluxe Version of Far Cry 3 with your purchase. I get that this might not be what you were hoping to hear, but the Standard Edition of Far Cry 3 is advertised with the Far Cry 5 Season Pass purchase on the Epic Games Store. Please visit this link for more information: [https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-U...-5/season-pass](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/far-cry-5/season-pass)

I truly hope you understand our position, as it is never our intention to make you feel as if you're being mistreated or that your request is being ignored.

Your understanding and patience are highly appreciated. Thank you for being a part of our awesome community!

If you encounter any issues in the future or simply want to get clarification about something, feel free to reach back to us and our team will be happy to try assisting you!

I use this for lots of stuff because my I don't want my SSD drives bogged with things like email database files. Proceed with caution:*

1. *Make sure all Epic Games and the Launcher are not running.*
2. *Check Windows Task Manager and kill any Epic processes as well - e.g.* *EpicGamesLauncher.exe*
3. *Find the install location, the default Epic Root seems to be* *C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games*
4. *Move the folder to the drive you want it in - e.g.* ***D:****\\Program Files\\Epic Games*
5. *If you don't have the Junction tool installed - you can get it from* [*here*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/junction)*. Put it in a folder that the windows PATH can find.*
6. *Go to the command line (CMD seems better than PowerShell in this case) and change directory to the original folder root (e.g.* *C:\\Program Files)*
7. *Create a symlink, e.g. run* *junction ""Epic Games"" ""D:\\Program Files\\Epic Games"".* *This will create a new ""folder""called* *Epic Games* *which points to the D: drive. If you look at it in Windows Explorer there will be a little shortcut arrow on the folder showing it points somewhere else.*
8. *Test that the symlink is working...*
   1. *DIR ""Epic Games"". It should show you the files you moved to the new drive*
   2. *OR just browse it in Explorer - it should feel as though nothing has changed.*
   3. *The main difference is that if you browse your d: drive you'll see the folder is* *actually* *here.*
9. *Run Epic. To the game launcher nothing should have changed.*
10. *If for any reason you need to delete a junction run* *junction -d ""C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games""*

Just as an update, the cmd shell in Windows 10 includes an internal command called mklink which can also be used for creating symbolic links. So for example, I just moved Borderlands 3 from I:\\games\\Borderlands3 to J:\\games\\Borderlands3 following steps 1-4 here. Then all I needed to do was open cmd as admin, go to I:\\games and run  


Code:  
mklink /D Borderlands3 j:\\games\\Borderlands3  


The dir command in cmd shows this in I:\\games now:  
Code:  
09/11/2019  12:54    &lt;SYMLINKD&gt;     Borderlands3 \[j:\\games\\Borderlands3\]  


Borderlands 3 launches same as before. Somewhat faster since my J drive is an SSD and I drive is not.",Please allow us to safely change installation folder and not have to go complicated cmd stuff and which may not even work and corrupt save files,0.99,1591722741.0,2020-06-10 17:12:21

# Ignore the title, was never free

So like many others I got AC Odyssey free on EGSLeft it for a while and downloaded it a few days ago on EGS, clicked launch and nothing happens

Browsing online I found some people saying to move the install to the windows SSD, which I totally could not do, having 20GB of a 250GB windows drive free.

Browsed the EGS Odssey download files and found an exe in there, looked like it was for the main game. Launching that manually opens Uplay, (which was already installed and signed in).

Now this is something that EGS was clearly incapable of doing, no idea why. Either way it signs the game onto your uplay account as if you paid for it, and prompts you to download it in uplay (despite already downloading 70GB in EGS, I know.

Redownload it (to any drive of your choice) and launch with uplay, game works fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a PSA to those wondering, you do not need to free up space on your C drive, you just need it to link to Uplay :)

here take a look:

[https://www.similarweb.com/website/steampowered.com?competitors=epicgames.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/steampowered.com?competitors=epicgames.com)

this will most likely change soon enough and steam will surpass epic again in june because of the steam summer sale but its really interesting to see the growth of EGS.

there are other sites that do this like alexa ranks but that site uses 90 day stats and doesn't work in this instance

I mostly use Steam and I'm not familiar with the region locks on Epic. I've heard about regional pricing, but suppose that I let him buy the game with my account, is there going to be a region restriction when I want to play it from the US or do I need like a VPN to play the game?

It almost seems to change how it loads week by week, and it happens with both Firefox and Internet Explorer, disabling addons did nothing either.

After a stupid amount of back and forth eventually I got told:
 ""I would like you to provide a new email address that has never been used for any registration with Epic Games account which we will use to update your account.""

Sorry for the vent but this level of customer service is just ridiculous. It's like talking to a calculator.

Finally I thought... Sent them the email address I wanted it changed to. They then replied saying that they have changed my email address to one that I have never even seen before! Literally, no mention in any string of emails has mentioned this email address and suddenly that is now attached to my account??

So basically, I logged into fortnite and I found that everytime I entered a match, my game crahsed, with an error along the lines of "" corrupt files"". I watched a youtube vid saying that I should delete my engine folder, my binaries folder, and my persistentdriveDir folder. Then i should verify fortnite and then launch. What ended up happening was the verify counter would get stuck at 90%, and even after a movies worth of waiting, it wouldnt budge. I tried pausing and resuming the verification process, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling my game, and that did not work either. I also deleted epic games launcher, and reinstalled fortnite, and the same thing. I ran multiple hard drive tests, which all came back good, I ccleaned my files, and i almost reinstallled windows. The three folders I deleted, i was able to get back two of them, with presistentdownloadDir unable to recover. When I install fortnite, it is the only folder missing, so I assumed it was the reason I could not launch. Ive been trying to fix this for three days now, and cant find anything to help.

Hi everyone, I'm currently facing an issue with Epic Games where I'm trying to delete my account as I do not utilize it and I put in my deletion request on 18th May 2020 after changing my password due to suspicious activity being detected. I received a response on 1st June 2020 which required me to fill in a list of details such as my IP address, date of account creation, transaction details, etc. I've never made any transactions so I don't have any to present and I don't think it's safe to divulge my IP address. The other details such as the associated account name can only be accessed through logging in.

The main issue is that Epic Games flagged my account as inactive after I made the deletion request and I'm unable to log in to view the required details. I had an email conversation with a customer service representative (who replies like a bot) and they basically told me: ""We can't verify your ownership of the account so we cannot delete the account. If you still wish to delete the account, please create a self-service deletion request so we can start the process again"". Now note that creating another deletion request requires me to log into my account, which I can't due to it being flagged as inactive. I don't get it; why do I have to jump through so many hoops just to delete my account?

Has anyone else tried deleting their Epic Games account? I'm unable to find any means of contacting Epic Games as their portal requires you to log in to access the contact page, which I can't.

It opens up the black screen and goes directly to ""Verifying..."" and sits there.

Had small issues prior where I would have to task manager force close and then reopen Epic Games Launcher in order for it to pass the ""Verifying..."" black screen. Did a windows update today and I am now stuck in the screen indefinitely. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I have 

\-Completely disabled my Windows Firewall (I have no other Virus software installed)

\-Reinstalled the launcher a handful of times

\-Cleared the registry with CCleaner

\-Added to the launcher target "" -http=wininet"" tried it and then ""-OpenGL""

\-Cleared the %localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher

\-Updated Drivers

\-Restarted between every change

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting a couple things that state ""Epic Games"" when I do the registry cleaner on CCleaner, one of them being ""Application Paths Issue C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Epic Games\\Launcher\\Portas\\SelfUpdateStaging\\Install\\Portal\\Extras\\Redist\\LauncherPrereqSetup\_x64.exe""

I was getting 1 or 2 others showing up in CCleaner Registry cleaner but have yet to replicate so I could record the ""error"".

So a CA$16.49 purchase price can't have a coupon applied that has a minimum $14.99 purchase requirement because EPIC is dishonest about the details.  Lame.

Total bailout on UT4 too. Why they even bother keeping it on the store when the community content created for the game isn't being added is beyond me. Zero effort. 

I can understands Epic wanting to put money where its investment will grow, but it costs them nothing just to do a source code dump for old versions of games they don't care about anymore. 

I think that Epic owes this to the gaming community that enabled Epic to become the gaming behemoth they are today and it costs them literally nothing.

And it's not just the launcher, my whole computer start working slower and slower until i restart it (it might be because my computer shows that the memory usage is 99%, but it didn't do that before I deleted and tried to reinstall World War Z, like the first time I installed it, there were no problems).

1590915222,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gtvnpa/before_you_ask_for_help_with_epic_games_support/,"This will be a lengthy post, sorry in advance. 

My objectif with this post is to save people time and effort if they have any issue with their account and want to ask for help, it also gives guidelines on what you might want to write down in terms of  informations. 
Obviously I haven't been the smartest when it comes to mine which ended up me being in such a situation. 

For the story:
I suddenly wasn't able to connect to my epic games account last Thursday, no idea if I typed wrong passwords too many times or else anyway I waited to see if I could reconnect but I still couldn't so I went to ask for help to the epic games support.

The first email asked for my epic game account registered email, username, account holder name and any account it might be linked to. 
After answering to this email I got a second email asking me for 8 more type of information regarding my account which made me understand that they were onto me trying to see if I was indeed me. 

Here is my last email back to them where I might be slightly out of line but hey nobody is perfect. 
Anyway it shows you what type of information to keep with yourself just in case, I on another side got rid of too much too early I guess 😅:
If you read till the end of the email I also make some suggestions for epic games, tell me if anything makes sense to anyone else. 


Hi xxxx,


Just to help clarify a few things: 

I am French but lives in Japan and have spend extended time working in the US.
I have a french and japanese credit card.


Now to answer your questions as best as I can:


1. IP address xxxxxxxxxx


2. Date at which I created my account is unknown as I no longer have the email sorry. I can only say end of February 2019 or early March 2019.


3. I did not keep the purchase numbers emails for more than a month, again I bought World War Z the 12 April 2020 and got Dauntless on the 15th of May, I also have Metro Exodus that I bought a year ago when I was in the US for 3 months.


4. Purchasing was done from xxxx City, xxxx prefecture in Japan and xxxxx USA.
I have never used non real money.


5. I don't think I ever changed my account ID, my Dauntless and World War Z ID is xxxxx I am sure of that and you can check that. Now because of you I am doubting myself on the epic username, if the in game username can be different from the epic username then it I would not be surprised if my epic username is xxxxx.

I have never played Fortnite.


6. last 4 digit of purchase card are, xxxx but the card is not registered with the account as I do not keep credit card data on my accounts for safety reasons.

My first purchased was Metro Exodus, I think the credit card used was the same so xxxx (my french card) but it might have been xxxx (my japanese card).


7. My last login is Wednesday 27th of May.


8. No gaming account connected to this account, I do not stream and do not own any console.


All of this is 3 times more information than you should be asking for, do you think I am some super thief that succeeding into hacking one persons epic games and google account and know where he was when he bought the games and know his credit cards ????

Seriously if I put it this way you realize how it looks to me right ?


If it comes to it you can video call me on Facebook or Line, I am sure I can provide enough official paperwork to prove that I am me &gt;&lt;


[PS:

This is just me trying to say what is on my mind, you can just not read it at all but you can also send that to the improvement department or data security department or else:

Why is there a need for so much information ??!! 

Sending a confirmation email to the epic games account email address? or a password change email, or even a situation email on why the account is inactive seems much more normal.

This process asks for more information than I would have to give for some official papers, what about adding birthday and birthplace and parents birth names to the accounts info, that can't be faked and is easy to remember if you are the actual person.

Asking for people to keep every email they receive sounds a bit of a stretch and similarly who keeps every receipts of everything they buy?


Is this the normal process of someone who typed a wrong password too many time?

If by some miracle you give me back my account I am setting some quadruple verification just to avoid this whole useless process seriously this makes no sense at all, I have been using Steam, Uplay, Origin and Bethesda for years and spend much more money there and I have never had even one issue.


If I can ask for improvements, in the future please have the launcher give more info like why you cannot connect or number of failed attempt on password and a prompt asking to change password if the person reaches 2 failed attempts, most launcher or website do this.

I know I might sound annoyed but having to give that much information just to be able to play Dauntless with my friends, games which is free and in which I haven't spend any money yet, the whole situation just makes me laugh. 


My second point is that there should be an automated process and simpler process to know what is going on in this situations. Wrong password or any other reason?

I have currently no idea why my account is in this situation, so to me it all seems like you are trying to rob me of the money I spent on your platform.]


Sorry for ranting, please understand.

The steam store is also heavy for a high-end PC like mine, despite it being a web browser integrated into the client.  The steam policy is really bad and the assistance I think is even worse.  The discounts are now part of the past, there are not as many discounts and convenient as at the time, now if you want to take a discounted game go to instantgaming etc ... The Epic store in addition to being lighter offers a more minimal and  functional compared to steam (I take the steam community as an example, I have never understood its true meaning in more than 5 years, rather use any social, like reddit lmao).  Honestly, I broke my balls to hear that the epic is not safe because it is taken in part by tencent, I mean, they are Chinese, so are they automatically harmful?  (ah nice thing, companies like Riot Games are supported in part by tencent, but no one has ever complained).  The ""problem"" of the exclusives is bullshit, it is not the epic to force the developers with a gun aimed at the temple, but they are the ones who choose where to publish their game.  Finally, Epic's base UI is much better than steam's (even if it's subjective as a thing).  After much more than 5 years on steam I'm happy that a decent launcher has come out.  I'll probably get a lot of downvotes, but people see Epic as a threat and don't open their minds to new, medieval-style things.

The download starts as any other, showing the full game size (about 39GB), when it reaches 100% at 39GB it ""expands"", shows something like ""39GB of 56GB downloaded"" and goes back to 0%, after completing 100% (again) it increases again to 90GB or something and it just.....keeps going?

I spent literally the entire day downloading it and got as far as 126GB before the download files get corrupted and I have to star over. This makes absolutely zero sense and I have no idea what to do, google gives me nothing. I know for a fact that the game's size is 39GB so wtf is happening?

Me: 
1. The associated email address is (hacked email) . The problem is, the person who hacked my account hacked it through my email and then locked me out of said email, so I can’t use that email anymore. 
2. My Epic Games display name should be (user)
3. My first and last name is (name) but it could also be registered as (user) (which is the name i put for my hacked email). This might be wrong, please let me know if it is.
4. I have Played games from Epic on my XBOX, but ai don’t think I ever connected the accounts together. Either way the platform is Xbox One S and my display is (username)

(At the next email someone else from epic responded) 

Epic: 
Thank you for following up with us! I will be assisting you with your account concerns. Before anything else, I'd like to apologize for the delayed response as we are currently experiencing a huge influx of tickets. Please know that we are working hard to get back to everyone, so I kindly ask for your understanding.

--The Transaction number can be found in your emailed Xsolla receipt.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Me: 
I don't know if I explained this well enough in my last email, but the person who hacked my Epic Games account hacked my linked email as well and changed my Epic Games password and my email password, meaning I don't have access to my linked email anymore. For this reason, I won't be able to get some of exact information you requested but I'll try my best to guess, so sorry in advance. The linked email I had was (hacked email), which you can see is one of email accounts in the screenshot below as proof, and I can't access this to get my information (screenshot) 

Anyways, I'll answer to the best of my ability.
1) I'm not sure what you mean by receipt but here is a screenshot from my App Store Apple ID that I bought V-bucks for Fortnite for my brother (he plays fortnite on my epic account cause I don’t). If you meant something I would have received an email for, well I can't really get that anymore.
(Screenshot)
2) My public IP Address is (ip)
3) a drawback of not having my email, I don't know when I first made my account. I just remember my friend asking me to create an epic account in April. I think around April 2018 I might have played the game but I don't remember definitely but still best guess would be that I made my account on around April 15, 2018 (as that is the day my friend asked, on a special day of his, that I don't want to explain since it's private).
4) Purchases for this account were made in (city,state) and maybe (city, state). the V-bucks for my brother were most likely in (city), the account creation could have been either in (city or city), as I don't remember where I was exactly at the time.
5)  The original display name might be a problem as I have a bunch of different names for different games and I change them quite often. Most likely, my Original name was (user). As of now, it's (user) but I'm pretty sure this was changed from the original, which was most likely (user). It could also have had been something with the names (user or user) but I don't think so
6) Last 4 numbers should be (cred card numbers)
7) The date I last played was May 16, 2020, where I was playing a solo game and then reverted back to the main screen. After trying to log in I was met with an ""invalid credentials"" error. I would estimate I was last able to access my account at 11:40ish AM on that day
8) I had an XBOX account connected to my games from Epic account, I don't know if that counts as what you are asking. But the XBOX account connected to my Fortnite is (user) (idk if you need the email connected to the account as well, but contact me if you do). I don't know when it was connected, and I have no idea how to check that, but I know I got it around the same time as when I got XBOX Live Gold, so I'd estimate around November 23, 2018. Sometime around there would make sense.
9) yeah ok, I have no way to really get this info since I don't have access to my paired email, so I can't really answer this one.
I hope I did enough to verify it's me, but if not please contact me again so I can correct whatever the problem was.

Greetings,

My name is Kilo (name) and I will be stepping in since my colleague is currently away. Pleased to meet you!

I know that having your account compromised can be quite troublesome.

We sent a password reset email to the email address registered to your Epic Games account. Please follow the steps in that email to reset your password.

After you reset your password, please reply to this message so we can continue restoring your account.

Regards,
Kilo (name)

Me:
Excuse me, I assume that since I was sent a password reset to the linked email I passed the verification process. unfortunately, if you look at my previous emails you will see that I do not have access to that email account anymore as it has been hacked as well. Can we please change my linked email to (new email)

TL;DR: I went through the account recovery process from Epic and answered as many questions as I could (some I couldn’t since my email was hacked and I couldn’t access it for info) and it seems like they just cant understand that.

They haven’t responded to me yet but I find it annoying that every time I have to explain that I cannot access my email and they just copy paste instead of reading my previous emails. I mean he just gave the account password reset to the hacker like wtf? Can Epic change my linked email, like is that allowed from their part?

I made a post some days ago where i showed the wrong description (german version) for the ""Maya &amp; Gran Clomubia Pack"" in the epic games store.  
Since they dont want to refund me the ""Pack"" because i played the Game himself (i never picked Maya or Gran Columbia, neither had the AI picked it) more than 2 Hours (even before i bought ""Rise and Fall"") i want to inform you that the description is still wrong in the shop.  


I hope there will be a fix (since a friend of mine had the same problem) and finaly a refund :)

I dont care for the full money, but i dont want to pay for their faults...

If you buy over the browser you instantly notice the Maya and Columbia URL after clicking on it. If you just straight bought it over the the app, you dont have a chance to see it.  


Hope this post prevents other from buying this pack in hope to get ""Rise and Fall"" and plzzzzz Epic fix this wrong description!

well EGS seemed it was starting to open a bit more with the start of 2020. they started bringing in more AAA titles from publishers other than ubisoft. then they started bringing in games that went free at launch for a limited time( TRDS,). and just a couple days ago they announced a 1 week exclusive, not  1 year, 1 week,and its going to be free for that week(SS neo geo col.)

Well we get to today. its seems like Epic strategy has succeeded and they got so many players to the point where their is officially, for the first time in EGS history, a game that:

\- isn't AAA

\-isn't launching for free for a limited time

\-isn't exclusive

\-launching on both epic and steam at the same time for the same price

just a small indie title that decided to put their game on both epic and steam at the same time for the same price. it's called poly bridge 2 ( i actually played the first one and it was super fun)

Now this doesn't mean that they will be stopping free games or exclusives any time soon. it just means that more and more games are coming because epic are going to stop manually dictating what games are on the store

this also might mean a small deal between the game's devs and epic and we might be getting poly bridge 1 for free sometime soon

something that's for sure is that epic are starting to garner a playerbase that is good enough for epic to not care about their sales compared to steam's. and that what tim sweeney said last year might be starting to happen. and that is that EGS is starting to open its doors more and more....hell we might actually get DARQ someday.",Epic games store starting to open its doors?,1.0,1590666287.0,2020-05-29 11:44:47

**Welcome to the Tech Support Megathread.**

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issues which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

*As of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision, all tech issues regarding non-recent topics should be posted to this megathread. Use common sense to determine what is recent and what isn't (As a general rule: any current free game or any release in the last two weeks would count as recent). Please post all other tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

[You can find the previous megathread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gnyncr/tech_support_megathread/)

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[Solutions/Fixes Google Doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing)

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Thanks for your time and patience.

1590571997,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/grgkb6/xbox_controller_issues_only_on_epic_game_store/,"Hi all,

Been tearing my hair out over this for a week...

Have been playing Zombie Army 4 (which is awesome, by the way), and using an Xbox ELITE series 2 controller. Randomly, the controller would often stop working, with the Xbox button flashing. It's fully charged, so it's not a battery issue.

I thought it might be the wireless adapter, so used bluetooth - same thing.

Then tried it with a 'normal' Xbox One controller - same thing happens when connected via the adapter or bluetooth.

Then tried a couple of other games via EPIC (Control and Borderlands 3) - same problem.

Tried games in Steam - no issues at all.

I bought the SRTTR in the epic games store. However, the game isn‘t launching. When pressing launch it loads for a couple of seconds and goes back to normal. Game doesn‘t start and no error is displayed. It simpley doesn‘t even react. I also got the error message LS-0013, but only once.

Does anyone of you know a possible solution?

I already tried:
- Reinstalling (epic launcher &amp; game)
- Installing the game on a diferent harddrive
- Run as adiministrator (epic launcher &amp; game)
- Updated to Windows 10
- Download latest CPU driver
- verified the game files
- Rebooted modem

I would be so grateful for a solution.

I store my games on an HDD every time a game updates it becomes severely fragmented. this is something intentional because the data is downloaded and overwritten in the games directory moving and splitting files around.  

I like steams method to prevent fragmentation and adds a layer of redundancy it gose like this.

1. all the files being updated are copied from the game to the downloaded folder
2. then applies the updates to the files.
3. varifies the new files. 
4. deletes the files that are going to be replaced in the games directory. 
5. copies the new files.
6. varifies the hole game
7. delete the files in the downloads folder

I know this method is bad if you have the games on a SSD but you can use windows mklink to point the downloaded folder to an HDD

doing this will prevent fragmentation because the old files are being fully deleted then the new ones being copied over instead of overwritten in the location of the game. 

I like the redundancy if the download gets corrupted. the game itself is not going to be corrupted because steam will delete the corrupted file and repeat steps 1-3 for the corrupted files.

1590464667,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gqpmn6/liking_epic_more_and_more/,"I find more and more lately I'm enjoying the epic store. Steam used to have big sales but have paled in the last 5+ years and in fact even their biggest sales of the year I rarely buy anything anymore. I play almost exclusively single player games and have no interest in the competitive nature of online gaming meaning that Epics sales actually mean something to me when I can save 40% off a game and apply a 14$ coupon on top of that for a game it's fantastic. The fact is most games we play for a few dozen hours and then never play again unless they really grab us and that makes it hard to justify a lot of game pricing. About two years ago now I said I'll never buy another triple A game at launch, I'll wait for pricing to go down and the fact is in most cases it doesn't go down which means Epics store pricing and deals go a long way towards me getting more games.  


There are definitely some QoL fixes that need to be done both to their storefront and to our libraries but I really am enjoying it. I went from a hardcore steam supporter (I have 800+ games there) and a hater of Epic to somewhere in the middle but more and more Epic is reminding me of the way Steam used to be. Fact is Steam started way worse then Epic did and I think most people have forgotten that as time has gone by. I look forward to seeing where Epic goes and I honestly think in another year or two if they keep up with what they are doing they will overcome Steam.  


Afterall isn't it all about the game anyway?

After playing the tutorial I was really disappointed. It was far away from what I was expecting. I was aware of the refund conditions (max. 2 hours playtime, within 14 days of the purchase) so I checked playtime in the client and it was below one hour. So gave it another try, played the first mission and quit, so my playtime was 1 hour 19 minutes. Next day I decided to request refund, because I was so disappointed. The self-refund function was not introduced yet, so I requested it via support message. I got the answer, that they are busy but they will respond in a few days. So they did after a couple of days, writing that I should try self-refund, which was introduced in the meantime. I was not able to do that, because the option was not available in my account page. So here started a ridiculous email chat, where they kept saying that I'm not eligible for refund and my playtime exceeded the 2 hours limit and I kept saying, that I'm sure, that I'm not, and they own system is showing the opposite. At this point I'm frustrated and angry. Is there any option left for me to get my money back?",Refund rant,1.0,1590368746.0,2020-05-26 01:05:46

The $10 coupon and sale together dropped the price to $8 and so I finally grabbed it - this is easily the best $8 I’ve spent in DECADES.

This game is colorful, wicked funny, has a ton of heart, isn’t crazy-hard like a lot of recent games want to be, is mostly family-friendly (there’s a couple vaguely inappropriate “advertisements” on the weird-ass TV in the ship), and actually makes you think about the gameplay instead of mindlessly killing hordes of generic bad guys.

I initially thought it was going to be a survival/builder like Subnautica, but it’s actually a modern full-3D metroidvania (think Metroid Prime or Arkham Asylum), just without any humanoid enemies.  Explore, scan the plants and animals, get new skills, go back to old areas and use the new skills to get to hidden/locked areas, and explore some more.

Overall, this one gets a 9/10 out of me - I just wish it were longer (although I’m not done yet, so there might be a twist that extends it, or an NG+ type feature.  I’m bigtime hoping for DLC or sequels.  :-)",Journey to the Savage Planet,1.0,1590354408.0,2020-05-25 21:06:48

1590256329,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gp99ug/solution_to_fixing_blank_window_when_starting_the/,"I had some troubles getting the Epic Games Launcher to work after switching monitors. I found the solution and I wanted to share in case anybody else has the same problem.

This solution is relevant for you if:

* the window of the Epic Games Launcher appears blank, except for the settings icon

* you're using multiple monitors or have switched monitors at some point

* (your OS is Windows 8.1)

Here's how to fix it.

If you're using multiple monitors or have switched monitors at some point, they might not have the same pixel density (number of pixels per surface area). Windows will (sometimes) automatically change a setting to account for this, or you might have changed it yourself. This setting is called ""Change the size of all items"" and can be found under:

1) right-click the Windows icon on the taskbar

2) click Control Panel

3) Appearance and Personalisation

4) Display -&gt; Make text and other items larger or smaller

Then make sure that ""Smaller - 100%"" or ""Medium - 125%"" is selected, AND ""Let me choose one scaling level for all my monitors"" is checked. Then restart the Epic Games Launcher. It should now work as intended. Downside of doing this is that items might appear too big on one screen and/or too large on another. I also noted that when I use different scaling levels per monitor the program works on one monitor, but not on another.

Please let me and others know if this worked for you.","Solution to fixing blank window when starting the Epic Games Launcher (multiple monitors, Windows 8.1)",1.0,1590213129.0,2020-05-24 05:52:09

- **Subnautica:** Beautiful, relaxing game. I have never finished it before so this gives me a reason.

And the mod that simplifies crafting by automatically grabbing materials from your storage and automatically crafting intermediary materials.) *I didn't buy the next game ""Below Zero"" since it is still in early development and not worth playing yet since it's so rough.*

- **Control + Season Pass DLC:** This game is a bit overrated but still very good. And thanks to the sale on both the game and its DLC, I was able to get it for an amazing price. I love the storytelling of Remedy (the game studio) and their head writer Sam Lake, and this game is no exception.

- **Detroit - Become Human:** One of the most impressive games I have ever seen. Love the design aesthetic, the graphics, the story, the world. It's seriously impressive. And was available for a great price during sale. *PS: The game has had optimization patches a few months ago and now runs perfectly on PCs, so ignore any old reviews.*

- **Beyond Two Souls:** Enjoyable game. Really nice way to pass some time. Not a masterpiece but definitely very good and cinematic!

I turned my pc on and launched epic games launcher but then I encountered an error, first with just launching the launcher and second, with signing in. So naturally I go off to the interwebs to find a solution. Most pointed out to try and reinstall the epic games launcher. In my head, that's fair, many applications do that to solve problems. So I did it. It didn't fix the problem but not long after I found a method that did fix it and I was able to get into my account.

Little did I know uninstalling the launcher uninstalls my games too. So here I am redownloading the game I wanted to play which has a size of 94GB. It will probably take me 3 days at best before it completes the download as my download speed's peak is 500kB/s (that's with no other apps that uses heavy bandwith and other devices connecting to my network).

I just wish there was more of a warning that when you re-install the launcher(because you want to fix the launcher), it would uninstall my games too. Or have it be backed up. If I knew it would've done that, I would've chosen to find another way instead of uninstalling my launcher 100%.

Time to read a book I guess since I don't want my download speeds to go even lower than it is.",TIL uninstalling the launcher also uninstalls all the games,1.0,1590165048.0,2020-05-23 16:30:48

Much like GOG, Epic has a higher over all level of quality compared to some other stores, there it more than one,  that allow pretty much anything and everything on.  For me, a store that has more focus on quality makes for a more enjoyable shopping experience, it also makes me more likely to buy a brand new game that really isn't getting much exposure, currently, from Streamers and others, because I trust the store has been having a good quality control, despite making a small number of mistakes.  Mistakes will happen since humans are involved, but they don't happen very often, and that is what the refund period is for.

- 3 games with 30-40's (though one game with a score of 45 has been massively improved since release, getting the ""No Man Sky"" type of treatment, should be in the low 70s by now, imo)

I searched for all the possible argument options in the executable and I found the following:

\-localize\_language

And it works!

So just go into your Epic Launcher settings, scroll down to ""SAINTS ROW THE THIRD REMASTERED"", enable ""Additional Command Line Arguments"" and put the argument above and next to it a supported ISO 2 letter language code.

Example for Spanish:

\-localize\_language es

Supported languages are

So I purchased the Far Cry 5 Gold Edition from Epic Games Store exactly a week ago(Friday). Their description for the season pass(included in the gold edition) and the gold edition claimed to include Far Cry 3. I wanted both so I purchased it as soon as possible but, it didn't deliver. I contacted Ubisoft Support first and they told me that it should have been delivered by now(3-4 hours after I purchased the game) and they told me to contact Epic Games support. So I did what they said. I created a support ticket and waited a week.

And this morning, a week later, when I woke up, I saw the response they sent to me:

 ""I hope you are enjoying the game Far cry 5, there was an issue when the promotion was listed on store but all players with that problem have been granted with Far Cry 3.  
The promotion now listen on Store includes:  
The Gold Edition includes the game, the Digital Deluxe Pack &amp; the Season Pass which includes 3 new experiences.""

So...they gave others Far Cry 3 and now they don't? I don't get it. It's not in my Ubisoft or Epic Games library either. If it's not gonna deliver, isn't this a scam since the Gold Edition is supposed to include Far Cry 3? Should I contact support again or should I just not do anything and keep continuing my normal life?","I Purchased Far Cry 5 Gold Edition From Epic, Which Was Supposed To Include Far Cry 3, But It Didn't Deliver And The Support Response Isn't ""Supportive"" At All",1.0,1590091599.0,2020-05-22 20:06:39

Why?

First thing it suggests is they **Know** whether or not you actually use the games in your library. The second thing that occurs to me is, 'Why would they care enough to try and provoke me to play them now?'

I think it has something to do with Epic's shaking the bottle. I suspect the reason Gaming has languished in a perpetual ""adolesence"", becoming increasingly unhealthy along the way, is due to Steam's dominance in the industry. Gabe Newell seems like a nice guy and all but it's clear Steam has gotten super fat, basically sucking up *all* the oxygen and resources of the gaming industry to such an enormous degree it's ***required*** a rival to literally give away AAA games ***For Free*** to make it shuffle it's enormous arse on it's enormous throne.

Innovation in the industry was already being suffocated by the big Studios avaricious hunger for profits but Steam, along with Valve, has always been pretty much the Heart &amp; Soul of 'Computer Gaming', and it forgot, kind of like King Arthur, who it Is.

Since Civ6 was given away today on epic game store I decided to get it there and play a little. But than got back to the steam version, but it felt like Epic version was running a bit smoother, so I decided to investigate it further and here are my findings:

Epic game store: 16.001 Ms average frametime. 8.55 average time per turn
Steam: 16.622 Ms average frametime. 8.50 average time per turn


So as you can see - the FPS on Epic is higher. Granted the difference isn't terribly big, bit Epic is staying above 60 FPS all the time, whereas Steam is staying just under 60, so the difference is important here. 

Testing methodology: deleted the game and installed on an external SSD. Reset the settings and set medium settings. Made 3 consecutive runs and averaged the results. 1080p, Dell XPS 9570 i5-8300H, GTX1050, 16GB RAM. Thermal throttling was not encountered as Turbo Boost for the CPU was disabled and EPP is set to 0. And performance didn't get significantly worse run-to-run.

I encourage everyone to try the benchmark for themselves to see if it is indeed the case or am I an outlier.

You offer a coupon for $10 off over every game $14.99. I use Euro, which is stronger then the Dollar. I want Witcher 3, which is €14.98, sneaky! But I cannot use the coupon! My price is in Euro though and €14.98 to USD is currently $16.42! Therefore the discount should apply if I look at your website!

This is what you state when I click the coupon information:

&gt;  
Qualifying games and add-ons must be a minimum price of $14.99 after any promotions and discounts are applied. Taxes and other fees do not apply toward the minimum purchase requirement. 

Therefore I should get the discount, even if it's a converted value from the USD

\*wink wink, nudge nudge\*

PS: I love your gamestore and the free games you offer, I know this is probably going to be fluff, since you probably stated somewhere (would like to see where though) that it's currency bound

1590077362,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gnzoer/why_epics_giveaway_titles_are_perfect/,"first of all for those who say that civ 6 is disappointing, let me remind you that you were going to be disappointed either way because nothing can top the most profitable piece of entertainment in history

remember that by just giving away insane games epic can't guarantee sales, every free game they give has to give them results. if epic gave out witcher 3, red dead 2..etc all in the same sale it wouldn't help them that much because its gonna be the same people that get them.

wouldn't be better to diversify and bring in completely new and different types of players to their store, and that is exactly what's happening here: the best selling AAA title ever,civ 6 the most played strategy game in the world, borderlands the biggest looter-shooter franchise in the world, ark one of the most played survival games in the world...it just makes sense

now all of this doesn't mean that games like witcher or red dead will never go free on epic, it just means that epic aren't throwing their best cards at the same time ( which is never a good idea ).

You might also argue that then they shouldn't have started it with a game that is so big and set expectations so high. i would argue that if you want the biggest possible attraction to your sale then what better way than giving literally the most wanted game worldwide. because once you come to the store you're gonna immediately get caught by the insanely low prices on other games( like the witcher 3)

plus i feel like people are getting a bit spoiled by epic. we got so attached to these free games that we started to put expectations and getting disappointed forgetting that THIS IS NOT A STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY

in conclusion, while you might never play civ 6 or ark or borderlands,but believe me a lot of people will and epic are about to get flooded with demand

plus just a side note: how the hell were epic supposed to surpass giving out the biggest AAA game in the world",Why Epic's Giveaway Titles are Perfect,0.83,1590034162.0,2020-05-22 04:09:22

***We are a community run subreddit and have nothing to do with Epic. None of the mods are from Epic, we have no contact with Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else*** [***email their support***](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) ***and let them know.***

Welcome to the fourth Tech Support Megathread.

Before we go further, you can find the previous megathreads below.

[First Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/evmlss/tech_support_megathread/)

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

[Third Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g3brrj/tech_support_megathread/)

[Fourth Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/)

For those that don't know, the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. The subreddit was riddled with tech issues which made it hard to sort through. So on 29-Jan-2020, we made it a rule to organize things in the megathread.

*as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision, all tech issues regarding non-recent topics should be posted to this megathread. Use common sense to determine what is recent and what isn't (As a general rule: any current free game or any release in the last two weeks would count as recent). Please post all other tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

If you want a moderator organised list of issues/solutions, check this doc out. You can also check out the wiki of our subreddit.

[**Solutions/Fixes Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing).

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Thanks for your time and patience.

There comes the real problem. It asks to start a fresh install of my RDR2. I can find the already downloaded 98GBs on the disk. But it doesn't verifies. 

On seeing some comments/suggestions over the air, I renamed the folder and started a new download. Then paused it and copied the files from the old folder to the new one without closing the epic launcher. And, I cancelled the installation, so that I can click resume to verify the file.

As I expected, it verified. But only 13 GB  of the downloaded file. Remaining are not verified. Again 101 GB to be downloaded.

Hello Epic Games I have a skin idea that i think You will enjoy. It is a variation of the season five battle pass skin red line. The female counterpart of burnout the idea is a edit style. That is where you can remove her helmet and show her face. Like the elite agent skin which is a battle pass skin as well. Also the overtaker and whiteout skin set  Have this edit style and is really the same skin idea .In concluding thoughts I really think this skin set would be beneficial to the game cosmetics especially for the og players that have this skin It would be nice if you could get back to me when convenient.

I did some researched and found some sites claiming you need to defeat the eater of world or its crimson equivalant in order to spawn meteorites. I'd like some clarification. Did they change this in master mode?

The launcher opens up to the login screen, and upon logging in \[either through normal sign in or through google\], it proceeds until **PREPARING THE EPIC GAMES LAUNCHER**, after which it simply redirects back to the login screen. 

This has been going on for a week now. I have found the cause of this error \[through troubleshooting in the settings menu\] to be : **REGIONAL ENDPOINTS FAILED - ERROR CODE: TS-NC-0001.**

I have attached a screenshot of the troubleshooting window along with this post. Additionally, I have found that troubleshooting gives me the same error, regardless of whether i do it pre-login or post-login attempt.

Upon going through the log files, I found the main error message to be the following:

* 'Failed to connect to [185.93.3.123](https://185.93.3.123) port 8080: Connection refused' , along with -
* 'invalid HTTP response code received: URL ...'
* libcurl error: 7 (Couldn't connect to server) 

Here is a list of the stuff that I've tried to do until now:

1. Uninstall and reinstall multiple times
2. Run the launcher as administrator
3. Turn off windows defender and windows defender firewall \[I do not have any other antivirus running\]
4. Login to my epic account through the launcher on another PC \[This was successful\]
5. Login to my epic account on the website \[Successful\]
6. Flush Dns, winsock reset, network reset, change DNS to Google's standard \[[8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8)\] 
7. Connect to another wifi network, hotspot and viz. ethernet
8. Completely uninstall including the programdata folder \[With hidden files\], x86 folder and the  localappdata folder.
9. Enable incoming and outgoing connections through port 8080 along with ports 5222, 433, 80 \[Both TCP and UDP  connections\] through windows defender firewall advanced settings. 
10. Allowed the epic launcher through windows firewall in both private and public networks.
11. Tried to launch in safe mode with networking.
12. Enabled logging for packet drops in windows firewall, which occasionaly showed a drop for port 8080.
13. Adding -http=wininet. -opengl and -skipbuildpatchprereq to shortcut target
14. Ran in compatibility mode for WIN8 AND WIN7
15. Updated network adapter drivers
16. Tried logging in on another user
17. Logging in through VPN

None of these have worked so far, and I've been unable to login even a single time on my laptop. Any help would be appreciated..

1. Simply go to your transaction history at [https://www.epicgames.com/account/transactions](https://www.epicgames.com/account/transactions) !
2. Click on the game.
3. It will show your Order ID, your Playtime, along with 2 buttons: ""Email Receipt"" and **""Request Refund"".**
4. **Click on ""Request Refund"".** This will open a dialog box where you can select the reason such as ""accidental purchase"" or ""doesn't work on my computer"" or whatever. As long as you have **&lt;= 14 days since purchase and &lt;= 2 hours played**, they let you refund for ANY reason according to their store policy at: [https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/billing-support-c99/epic-games-store-refund-policy-c101/epic-games-store-refund-policy-a4059](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/billing-support-c99/epic-games-store-refund-policy-c101/epic-games-store-refund-policy-a4059)

Just sharing a trick I found this morning while downloading a game.

I have terrible internet, around **200-300 kbs inconsistent spikes** from time to time while downloading on EGL, usually takes around an hour per GB.

While looking through the settings in the launcher, I found this (new ?) option ""**Throttle Download**"", and decided to set it to 400 to try it out.

Surprisingly, my download is really **smooth and consistent, and stays withing the 315 kbs** range as seen in the image which is an amazing improvement.

Suggest you try it out :)

Just today someone seriously believed that Epic will be going out of business once the free games stop coming and Fortnite becomes just another game.  

I immediately dismissed this as we all know from stats that Epic themselves have released that user growth on the store is good and the company has recently been valued at ~$15 billion dollars. Later on I got to thinking how much money does Epic as a company really make beyond Fortnite and Epic Store sales.  

So I took a recently released unreal engine game on PlayStation (Final Fantasy remake) and found it’s sold over 3 million copies in its first three days of release.  So just taking 60$x3 million sales x 10% cut for use of Unreal Engine = $18 million in revenue for Epic.  Now consider every other UE game that’s sold well in just the past six months alone and it becomes clear. 

People have severely underestimated the money Epic is taking in from its game engine alone and with UE5 and next gen consoles it’s only going to continue.  So buckle in because Epic isn’t going anywhere and they have the cash flow to keep both timed exclusives and free games coming for users.",Epic isn’t going “bankrupt”,1.0,1589906439.0,2020-05-20 16:40:39

Hello there,

Thank you for contacting Epic Games Player Support.

I understand that you're seeking assistance regarding the Far Cry 5 Gold edition. I'm here to clarify everything.

I'm sorry to hear that you're having issue with your purchase for Far Cry 5 Gold edition and the Far Cry 3 is not visible on your Library, allow me to please clarify everything. We have made adjustment and all affected players who purchased the Far Cry 5 Gold edition already received the Far Cry 3.

If ever you have any questions, concerns and inquiries please never hesitate to contact me again and I'll be more than willing to assist you.

Regards,
India Bravo

3)After this reply FC3 is still not been added in my library inspite of some backend changes which was mentioned by support so i opened another ticket and also replied to the earlier ticket with all relevant proofs and screenshots.

4)Its been more than 2 days and no further reply from EPIC and still waiting.

HOWEVER , i can confirm that EPIC knows FC3 is to be provided as their reply from support and a friend of mine who got FC5 gold(2 months back) got FC3 added in his EPIC account automatically , so its not a distant dream !!!But the the wait continues.

Kindly post below your experience so that we can bring in notice to EPIC on large scale.",Regarding Farcry3 after purchase of FARCRY5 Gold edition,1.0,1589844452.0,2020-05-19 23:27:32

It sure as hell isn't a launcher, because in order to be that it would have to actually launch a game. Hell, it can't even launch itself without crashing the first time and having me open it again. Then it opens up and the images and text are so enlarged I believe it thought I had glaucoma. There's the three horizontal lines in the upper left corner that presumable were supposed to open menus of some sort so perhaps I could get to settings, but it doesn't even open up if I click it. Hell, the launcher doesn't even acknowledge it's a button if I hover the mouse over it. Speaking of not being able to open the menu, because I can't navigate the damn thing I can't switch between the store and library. That means that every time I want to look at a different section than the one I'm on I have to close the application, right click it in the system tray, and then select where I want to go. If at this point I decide I haven't had enough punishment I can attempt running a game, but that results in crashes half the time as well, not to mention that just to run \[game from Rockstar which stupid automod thinks this post is about\] (which is the whole reason I downloaded this in the first place) I have to download the Rockstar Launcher as well. Although I'd have to download this to play the game on Steam as well, if I had done that I'd actually be able to play it. You see, Steam's launcher actually works, unlike Epic's which Rockstar continuously could not connect to except one single time. Since Rockstar couldn't connect to Epic I couldn't play \[game from Rockstar which stupid automod thinks this post is about\].

I came for the free game, stayed for the torment, and ultimately uninstalled this garbage software.

List of this type of games I know in Epic:

-Satisfactory (26.99€): This one I own. Pretty good if you want to build complicated stuff. Still in early access and I think it needs some quality of life features to make building larger projects bit less cumbersome.

-Old World (32.99€): ""Civ killer."" Seems decent but what I have heard it is very much early access and start to lag after 100 or so turns even with very good computer.

-Before we leave (17.99€): No idea.

-Industries of Titan (24.99€): Apparently very much early access and needs lot more features before much can really be said.

-Surviving the Aftermath (15.99€): Not sure at all how this is developing: I am tempted because price after coupon is probably cheapest it will get for years. Can anyone who owns this give some comments?

1589798996,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/glz8hx/new_to_epic/,"Hello All!

I just started into PC gaming as my main platform, and I had a question about the Epic store.  Is the store/launcher *really* as buggy as people make it out to be?  It's hard to differentiate between what's really someone having a tech issue versus someone just upset that the store made an exclusive deal.

I'd rather buy games on Epic knowing that the developers are getting a bigger cut (especially indies - those people work their butts off and deserve as much help as they can get).  I'm just hesitant to buy games on a launcher that may be really buggy since I've never used it before.

I figured it would be a good idea to address some things now that the newcomers are pouring in. First off, some of you may have noticed we follow the rules we've made pretty closely. Initially it was pretty easy going but as you have seen the launcher/games bring in **a lot** of tech issues. The community was upset by this since interesting posts got buried so we created the [Tech Support Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/). They are refreshed every 300 or so comments and automatically organized by new. When someone comes up with a functioning solution I usually reward them with silver to encourage help in there.

We have never really had to deal with so many memes before so we had to get together and figure out how we would handle them. We decided, for now, to make it so memes are allowed to be posted on days when a new free game comes out. 

---

**The mod team here is not associated or in contact with Epic.** There are about 3 - 4 active mods with 1 - 2 active at any given time. It has been extremely hard to find new moderators due to us being in a weird situation where we don't know who to trust. We have had people try and claim to be from Epic to become a mod and had people with a bias try to become a mod. We don't want this sub to be a debate over what store is better or any of that low effort nonsense. I don't think anyone with any sense is going to say the store is perfect right now. We want this to be a place to gather issues in the Tech Support Megathread (the only place we have confirmation Epic checks), share news about the store for those interested, let people discuss the progress/games, and to have a place where people don't have to get treated like crap for being curious.

---

Lastly I will just say to check the sidebar for the rules and be civil.

##Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

##I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?

[@EpicGames- ""If you receive this error, please wait 24 hours. You should then be able to proceed with downloading the game.""](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261297169925115905?s=20)

##I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?

Once claimed it is free to keep forever

##Where are my $1,000,000?

It will take Rockstar 7-10 days to credit the amount to your account. This has been already announced by [a banner in their store page](https://i.imgur.com/ViqCwp1.png).

##Can I use my existing RGSC account to claim the rewards?

Yes you can. But we don't know if it makes EGS login mandatory or not for your future sessions.

##The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?

Potato servers

##The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?

[Link to the solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/)

##I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

##After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

##Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.

This is not a bug. Rockstar has made this game unavailable in some regions. You can always work around it using other methods.

## Ownership error Code- 152

We are assuming the authentication servers are overloaded as hell. Give it a day or two. *Some users have been able to bypass it using VPN but the risk is upon you.*

*or* [this solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gkqy0h/gta_v_faq_and_tech_support_megathread_part_2/fqwo7kt/?context=3)

&gt;'Weird Solution' for Ownership Error 152 This error is not shown when i connect my PC using Mobile Data tethering. But when i connect using my Broadband i get this error again!! I do think it's related to some some blocked port in network that's why some people are able to bypass that using VPN.

Please do note that if you're facing issues specific to GTA V and unrelated to the Epic Games Store, you should try asking around GTA 5 specific subreddits or forums such as r/gtaonline or otherwise. I obviously won't stop you from posting here, but it's just something to keep in mind.

So, long story short, my friend from another country decided to gift me a game for Christmas, so he registered a new EGS account, bought a game there, and then gave this account to me. I believe this is illegal, but well, we didn't discuss it, because my friend wanted to make a surprise, so what's done is done.

Anyhow, I thought of changing the region of the account to my home region, but I haven't yet contacted EGS support out of fear of the account being blocked due to the aforementioned reasons. I have cast-iron proofs that I live in the country I want to switch to, but what are the odds they would be interested in how I got that account? I may come up with a story that I visited my friend for Christmas and made an account there so my friend could buy me a game as a gift, but well, this is simply not true and I have no proof thereof.

You might save more buying separately.  You get a $10 coupon for grabbing GTA 5, you can only use one per purchase, but you get one for every purchase. If you buy the base game and season passes separately, it can save you money because you end up with $20 or $30 off your purchase instead of just $10. Found this with Anno 1800 specifically if anyone wants that.
 
Anno 1800 complete edition - $59.99-10.00=$49.99

Anno 1800 base edition - $29.99-10.00=$19.99

Season 1 Pass - $17.49-10.00=$7.49

Season 2 Pass - $17.49-10.00=$7.49

19.99+7.49.7+49=$34.97 (before tax) 

Thats $15 dollars saved for an extra 5 minutes of calculator work. So before you buy, just check to make sure you aren't throwing away money at a time like this.

I also recommend you if you are reinstalling the game, don't delete that, instead rename it as to not wait for more time, in case this fails. Also, I would recommend that you have around 200-300 GB left on your whole computer, so your computer doesn't lag because of low space

First of all, download  [Recuva](https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva). Install it and open the wizard...

Proceed with the iterations and when it prompts and select the drive where you were downloading the game at first. 

It will scan for deleted files, and prompt you to select which files you want to recover. 

Select all the files you want (mainly the rpf ones...), then click next it will prompt you to select where you want the files to be copied to... 

Don't copy it to the same drive. The chances of recovering the files get decreased by that... During this time you can resume your downloads.

If you were re-installing the game before doing this procedure, cancel the installation and rename the file. When all the files have been recovered, open Epic Games and click resume. 

It shouldn't resume because you have renamed the file. So, it will install again. 

When its \~1 GB cancel it and close the launcher... Locate where you installed your 5mb files and go to .egstore&gt;bps&gt;Install. If you don't find this folder resume the download. 

When the folder is created proceed:  

Copy the .rpf files that you recovered, directly in the file mentioned above. Also, copy them, instead of cutting them, to just be cautious in case the folder itself is deleted by Epic Games. 

Now, it should read all the files and resume the download...

Hope it works!",Recovering deleted files of GTA V...,1.0,1589592364.0,2020-05-17 01:26:04

In light of recent events, we would like to update you on the situation and perhaps be more upfront to the community about the issues we are currently facing and hope to rectify any issues or bugs which arise.

As you may know, **Grand Theft Auto V: Premium Edition** was recently revealed as the mystery game as part of our Epic Mega Sale (from 21st May to 11th June). This led to a very large amount of traffic to our site and backup servers. We would like to mention that we were prepared for this situation but due to some unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to keep the servers alive. We have reason to believe that some individuals were claiming an extraordinary amount of this game through several accounts. These accounts have now been suspended in line with our ToS.

We would like to apologize for the issues and we want you to understand that we are aware of these issues. We are looking at all the complaints from players who have revealed the game and also those people who want to play other games in their library.

The good news is that most of our services are back online: [https://status.epicgames.com/](https://status.epicgames.com/)

Unlike many others, I had no problems downloading this crap, but when I tried to open the game it asked me to download Social Club (1gb) and so I did. Then it asked me for my account so I tried using my Xbox registered account with rockstar, unfortunately, I couldn't remember my password.

This is where the nightmare began... the captcha was RIDICULOUS. It took me 1hr to log in, seriously. I had problems remembering my password but fortunately, I managed to remember it, but MY FUCKING GOD that captcha... then I logged in.

I tried to open the game and it said that I had to do it over Epic, tried to open it on Epic and it said that I needed to install the launcher AGAIN. This went on and on a few times till it finally boot up. So I go in, and everything is a mess, resolution, mouse sensitivity, etc. So I went directly to graphics settings and change everything to how it should be on my laptop and the game tells me it needs to restart, so I click YES.

Game opens up again and surprise, nothing changed... so I do it again and again... and again and again. The game won't run properly. I went and check my drivers and everything on my computer to make sure it wasn't on me. Everything was fine. And the game still won't work properly.

#FAQs

##Moving Steam files to EGS

[Follow this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk0eob/copying_gta_v_steam_files_to_epic_games_verison/) by /u/Sk_Alooshy

##Moving Steam files without copying

[Follow this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk7owb/using_steam_gta_files_for_epic_games_gta_v/) bu /u/xevangz

##Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

##I am being told 'Your account is unable to claim more free games at this time'. What should I do?

[@EpicGames- ""If you receive this error, please wait 24 hours. You should then be able to proceed with downloading the game.""](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1261297169925115905?s=20)

##I claimed GTA V. Will I still have the game after the 21st, or will I no longer be able to play after that date?

Once claimed it is free to keep forever

##Where are my $1,000,000?

It will take Rockstar 7-10 days to credit the amount to your account. This has been already announced by [a banner in their store page](https://i.imgur.com/ViqCwp1.png).

##Can I use my existing RGSC account to claim the rewards?

Yes you can. But we don't know if it makes EGS login mandatory or not for your future sessions.

##The EGS shows my download speed as a lot slower than it should be. Is something wrong?

Potato servers

##The game is not showing up in the library. What can I do?

[Link to the solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjtp27/gta_v_megathread/fqp4aiu/)

##I submitted and email verification request for my Social Club account, but nothing is in my email. What's going on?

[Rockstar has already noted this](https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1261315821617455104?s=20). You can try to resubmit the request if you've wated 4 or more hours, but aside from that you just have to wait.

##After claiming GTA V, the green button says unavailable. What's up with that?

This seems to just be a visual bug. The game is still in your library like any other free game, just search 'Grand Theft Auto V' in the search bar around your library and you'll find it.

##Players from some regions (mainly around the Middle East) apparently can't redeem the game.

This is not a bug. Rockstar has made this game unavailable in some regions. You can always work around it using other methods.

Satisfactory was a game that I've had an interest in so I've been looking at the price every now and again and it's been sitting at ~$30 AUD (I'm from Australia) for the last several months. Now with the Mega sale and free coupon suddenly the price has been jacked up to $44.94, which is an increase of roughly $15 and the value of the coupon is $15 in Australia. Although the game does have a 10% ""discount"" during the sale which decreases the price to $40.44 so yes after the coupon is applied it's still cheaper than it normally is.

I'm just wondering if this is a temporary price hike for during the sale, or whether it will drop back down to its normal price after the sale/coupon ends.

A week ago when I tried to log into my account, it came up with an error that said that my account was inactive and therefore I could not log in.   


I have contacted customer support and it took them over a week to respond. I had to provide them with all sorts of data that is completely silly to expect from anyone. (Like what date was the account created? Who the hell knows this?)   
After providing them with the same information 3 times a customer service agent finally tells me that my account is closed and cannot be opened again.  


They say that my account has been involved in fraud and they have therefore closed my account. I have checked my bank account, there has been no fraud. There is no good reason why they have closed my account. It can't be cheating in an online game since the only games that has been played on my account are singleplayer games. (All unmodded)

Customer Support keeps saying they are sorry they can't help reopen accounts. (Yes, they actually said they were sorry this happened to me, but they can't do anything.)

I primarily had an Epic Account because I wanted to play Detroit Becoming Human. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Where can I get help when customer support clearly don't care. Is there a community manager on this subreddit that can help me? I can provide transcripts of my email correspondence with Tech Support.",Warning- Careful shopping at Epic Games Store. - Account inactive,1.0,1589536532.0,2020-05-16 09:55:32

I went online telling random people about the most recent free game on epic and got some odd kickback, since I thought what I was doing was helpful. I didn't really trust them considering their racist insults and incoherent swearing. The only real words that could be made out were ""Chinese laborers"", ""I like to spend money on things"" and calling me cheap. This made me curious.

Does me downloading it impact anything? The only negative I see is that Rockstar is losing sales from this. This begs the question ""who makes money off of this?"" because Rockstar is willingly doing this. I personally justify downloading it only for the starter pack because I know I never have and never will buy GTA money. I don't really know much about Epic and I blindly think ""free game? then get it"" even if I already have the game on steam. I don't see a downside because it's an unlimited resource.

**Culture=en-UK**

Change ""en"" and ""UK"" to what your region is, obviously mines English (en) and United Kingdom (UK). Then go to **File** and **Save**. Then reopen the client and it should be back to your native language.

1589545902,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gk893y/psa_mega_sale_ubisoft_games_standard_season/,"**Earlier today I purchased several Gold Editions of Ubisoft games only to find that I had overpaid when compared with purchasing the game and the season passes separately.** (Several of the Gold Editions contain minor cosmetic items that are not contained in the Season Passes, but are not worth the cost difference)

**Unlike the coupons from the winter sale, the coupons for this MEGA Sale can be used towards DLC**--so if you are missing a Season Pass (or in my case, the Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Edition), now is the time to get it at a discounted price. 

Someone on another thread pointed out that the Epic MEGA Coupon can be applied separately to the base game and the season pass in several situations, bringing down the overall price even more with only the loss of a few cosmetic items as compared with the gold editions.

For example:

**AC:Origins Standard $4.99 + Season Pass $5.99 = $10.98**. Whereas the **Gold Edition is 14.99**. So there is a $3 savings purchasing them separately.

**AC:Odyssey Standard $9.79 + Season Pass $9.99 = $19.78**. Whereas the **Gold Edition is 22.99**. So there is a $3.20 savings purchasing them separately.

**Far Cry 5 Standard Editions $4.99 + the Season Pass $ 7.49 = $12.48**. Whereas the **Gold Edition is $12.49**--this one is a wash, and the Gold Edition, although one cent more expensive is worth it for the convenience.

**Watch Dogs 2 Standard Edition $7.99 + the Season Pass $9.99 = $17.98**. Whereas the **Gold Edition is 19.99**--so a $2 savings buying them separately.

So in the case of all of the most recent Ubisoft Games with the exception of Far Cry 5 during the Epic MEGA Sale (with the $10 coupons), **it is actually more cost effective to buy the Standard Editions + Season Passes separately rather than the Gold Editions.**",PSA: MEGA SALE Ubisoft Games Standard + Season Passes are often cheaper than Gold Editions.

Thank you in advance;

All tech related questions outside the game should be asked in the Tech Mega Thread as shown in rule #6 on the right side of this sub-reddit.

I've put in over 1,000 hours into Grand Theft Auto V and I've noticed that this sub-reddit is filled slam full of new players to the game. So I figure I'd lend my expertise on the game itself.

I encourage ALL questions related to the game itself and I'll do my best to answer them for you. I also encourage people that have also put in numerous hours into the game to help answer questions as well. The goal of this topic is to help make your Grand Theft Auto V experience a learning experience.

Don't know how many bullets it takes to blow up a vehicle? Ask away. Don't know exactly what gun is best to take down a fence? Ask away. Don't know where to find snacks and armor? Ask away.

Now here is the second part of this post. The graphic settings.

I've spent countless hours(hundreds) mastering the graphic settings to Grand Theft Auto V catered towards maximizing performance while sacrificing very minimal visual fidelity as humanly possible.

Understand that these settings were created in 1440p resolution. So if you're playing in 1080p or lower, there *may* be a few that need tweaking. I do ask that you let me know exactly what you think may need tweaking because each of these settings are very delicate. Even the slightest tweak can hit both performance and/or visual fidelity in either a minor, moderate or major way. Fortunately for you, I know every single detail of every individual graphic setting in GTA V. How it affects both performance and visual fidelity.

All the settings in the game, all set to my personal recommendations.

* FXAA - On
* MSAA - x2/x4 (going any higher than x4 is not recommended)
* NVIDIA TXAA - Off
* VSync - Off
* Pause Game On Focus Loss - On
* Population Density - 0%
* Population Variety - 0%
* Distance Scaling - 50%
* Texture Quality - Very High (tweak this down if your GPU VRAM is 4GB or less)
* Shader Quality - High
* Shadow Quality - High
* Reflection Quality - High
* Reflection MSAA - Off
* Water Quality - Very High
* Particles Quality - Normal
* Grass Quality - Normal
* Soft Shadows - Sharp
* Post FX - High
* Motion Blur Strength - 0%
* In-Game Depth Of Field Effects - Off
* Anisotropic Filtering - x16
* Ambient Occlusion - High
* Tessellation - Normal
* Long Shadows - Off
* High Resolution Shadows - Off
* High Detail Streaming While Flying - Off
* Extended Distance Scaling - 0%
* Extended Shadows Distance - 0%
* Frame Scaling Mode - Off

If you have any questions related to these graphic settings or anything related to playing the game itself, I'm here to help and do my best to answer them.",Grand Theft Auto V Graphic Settings Guide + Tips/Answers For Beginners,1.0,1589466117.0,2020-05-15 14:21:57

I bought the game key when it's first release (not the steam version). Using the Social Club I activated it. 

Today I also get the free Epic Game version. Created a new account on the Social Club but I couldn't linked with the Epic Games. I've moved the GTA folder to the Epic Games' download folder, it has downloaded 7 GB of its own .exe files and the account is linked. But after that I couldn't play with my old account.  

To sum up,

 When I open the Social Club launcher, it shows ""Play on Epic Games"" and when I change to my old account on the launcher and try to open GTA, it says ""You are launching Grand  Theft Auto V from an Epic Games account linked to a different Social Club user  (\*\*\*\*\*\*). Do you wish to log in as \*\*\*\*\*\* instead and continue?"". 

When I  click ""continue"", it changes to my new Epic Games account and if I click  ""cancel"" nothing happens.  

I casually play with my old account but also I want to start fresh with my friends.

1589496874,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjx3jk/an_open_letter_to_egs/,"The Epic Game Store is at the forefront of becoming a major market player and is quickly becoming the second largest digital PC gaming marketplace for gamers.  This is no doubt not an easy task and continues to face growing pains throughout the months as features continue to be developed and added into the launcher and services continue to improve.  I think Epic however needs to refocus on usability for all users of the service.  It is not a great look when your store is down/unstable for 12+ hours and its even worse when platform instability prevents users from accessing their existing games.  I am fully aware that this crash is rarely if ever avoided on any platform when demand for an item is so high, however that doesn't mean Epic gets a pass on it. I want them to do better and these outages need to be contained far quicker in the future.  I am excited to see Epic already implementing a feature that alleviates the game launching by implementing an upcoming offline state for the launcher when internet connectivity is poor or not available, I hope they integrate it into their service so that if their is an outage the launcher will detect it and simply open in offline mode, rather then displaying an error and random languages (that is not a great customer facing experience) not to mention users having to go through Windows File explorer to launch downloaded games as the launcher becomes entirely inaccessible. Overall I am excited to see Epic continue to grow, and I have no ill will toward Epic but rather write this to encourage them to continue to optimize and streamline their services and eliminate these more unfriendly customer facing issues.  

**In summary : Epic Games Store needs to refocus on customer experience and work to minimize both downtime overall and provide users with a streamlined interface and messaging when their service is down, while continuing to allow users seamless access to their game library to play downloaded titles.**",An open letter to EGS,0.67,1589453674.0,2020-05-15 10:54:34

However there is another way... well its THE EGS(Epic Game Store Way), but then you question i don't have the EGS and i cant enter the website to get, well no problem you can still access the rest of the website so you can download the app! YEAY

The link to their store: [EPIC GAME STORE US](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/home)

and yes you can acess this website bc they're not sharing the same servers!(I think)

After that log in in your account or create an account via the app and select store.

Considering the surge of new visitors we're getting because of GTA V, we've decided to make a new Megathread solely for GTA V related issues, queries, and general info. Please post anything GTA V related here.

**I already have GTA V installed from a third party source and/or Steam. Do I really have to redownload it again?**

[Check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gjijnf/tech_support_megathread/fqmn39i?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

**Is it possible to play with someone who has the Steam version?**

Since GTA V ends up using the rockstar launcher in the end regardless, then yes, you should be able to play with others on Steam.

**I am from the Middle East, and I can't claim GTA V. What should I do?**

We've received multiple reports of this issue, and sadly, we don't have a solution. We've reached out to Epic for clarification, but in the mean time, nothing can really be done here.

**I can't open the Epic Games Launcher! I am getting a 404/503/504/whatever error! What should I do?**

You aren't alone. The Epic Games Launcher is under heavy load and is down for almost everybody at the moment. Just have patience. [Epic has already mentioned that they're working on a solution](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1260949362085150722).

***We are a community run subreddit and have nothing to do with Epic. None of the mods are from Epic, we have no contact with Epic, we cannot fix any issues for you directly, and it's up to the community to help each other when possible. If you have feedback about the store or anything else*** [***email their support***](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service) ***and let them know.***

**Welcome to the Tech Support Megathread, now for a third time since it was first created. Before we go further, you can find the previous two posts below.**

[First Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/evmlss/tech_support_megathread/)

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

[Third Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g3brrj/tech_support_megathread/)

**For those that don't know the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. News was getting buried by tech issues and most issues posted just got buried even more. It was pretty miserable. So on 29-Jan-2020 we made it a rule to organize things in the megathead.**

*Tech support questions and feedback are no longer allowed to be posted (as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision). Please post all your tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

To find a Moderator made attempt at organizing some of these issues check out this

[**Solutions/Fixes Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing).

You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Thanks for your time and patience.

I contacted Epic support the same day the fact happened, and now, after almost ten days (thanks covid), they refused to help me because ""I'm not the owner of the account, let us be contacted by the original owner"".

The fact is, my brother is 12 years old and he didn't even know how to act at some guy breaking in his account and changing every bit of sensitive data, furthermore, he's not a native English speaker nor he's practical with PCs.  
I told them the same things about his inability to take care of it by himself and they kept saying the same sentence about not being contacted by the real owner.

After the sixth reply of ""make him contact us"", I gave up and wrote another ticket... No, my brother did (?!).

How can this even be possible from a company that has over a hundred million kids playing its game(s)? How's it possible that googling for ""how to recover my stolen fortnite account"" shows half of the links like ""buy stolen fortnitie accounts""?

But, on my Epic account, it would not let me make any purchases and would not give me any reason as to why. The only other games I played on it was World War Z and Dauntless for a little while. So, I ended up making a new account with my alternate email just to purchase the game and I played on it for several months. 

Recently, Epic had an update when I tried to log in. Since this update, I have been unable to access this new account. I make my password schemes absolutely fool-proof and only use two emails, so the only thing that could have happened is I used another email and forgot about it. But, when I go to ""reset my password"" there is no default email in the text box. I have tried sending a reset email to all emails I have, to no avail.

I saw on the Epic website that there was some sort of glitch with password reset emails, that notification is down now. I emailed Epic support 3 weeks ago and still haven't gotten any kind of response. I just need to know what email was used! This is horseshit. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do?

1588933887,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/gfqr03/a_warning_to_all_who_purchase_from_epicgames/,"I thought i'd share my experience with EpicGames and their customer support.

I have had an account with Epic games since they started dishing out free games, because why not? Free is good! I have played numerous games online with a couple of close friends, World War Z being the most recent one.

In May last year, using a £10 off voucher, i purchased Satisfactory for £16.99. I then proceeded to play this game with a friend for around 50+ hours during several of their patches over the last 12months.

Fast forward to April this year and i logged on to add the latest free games when i noticed that my library had cut down from around 50ish games (i've claimed every free game) to only 12. This included my only purchased game of Satisfactory, now gone from my library.

I went through their troubleshooting answers which suggested i may have ""hidden"" them in my library or they might be on a different account.

Neither of most common answers resolved my issue so i proceeded to contact Epic Games Support. They responded quickly to state that they have checked my account and there are no missing games on my account and that i must have these ""missing"" games on a different account.

I'd like to think i'm a fairly switched on person but i thought, 'ok, maybe i am being a muppet here'. I tried to log onto epic games on my ONLY other email address and it informed me there was no account linked to that email address. To try and eliminate the possibility that i was in fact being a muppet, i asked my friend to let me know what my name was on his friends list that i played Satisfactory and/or World War Z. My friend responded to me with my name for the account that i was using. This to me, Confirms without doubt that i only have one account. If it was on another account he would have two names for me on his friends list.

Epic Games continued to insinuate that there must be another account and they asked me for a copy of my receipt for any of the missing games.

Easy i thought.... I logged onto my email account and searched for ""Your Epic Games Receipt"" and it brought up a list of about 10 entries. All of which were within the last month. Sadly, they were all in my ""junk"" folder. It turns out my inferior email account ""hotmail"" decided to place and then delete all of these receipts in my junk folder. Turns out, i am a muppet, and should have checked after each purchase!

I accepted partial blame to Epic Games for this but they didn't really care.

I provided them with my bank transaction ID for my purchased of Satisfactory, But they didn't really care.

I explained myself time and time again, but they didnt really care. At this point i questioned why i was even bothering over what was only £17 and a bunch of games i probably wouldnt play anyway.

After several weeks of back and forth emails they still say ""there must be another account"", despite proving to myself, at least, that this is simply not possible.

My only conclusion is that somehow, for whatever reason, my account was wiped and ALL games prior to March 2020 had gone from my account, free &amp; purchased. (With the exception of Fortnite and Unreal Tournament).

I for one will never use EPIC games again and am appalled by their lack of willingness to listen as well as their system for not being able to track my purchase or search for a copy of my receipt on their end, despite giving them the information any large company would need to track a purchase for goods within a 12 month period.

I will give credit to Epic Games Customer service for their quick responses, especially during these trying times. Credit where Credit is due.

Rant over.

Saber stated they have no plans to bringing the game to other PC stores.  Here is the relevant image from the video

https://i.imgur.com/LDhvZu4.png

This could be true for Snowrunner and Ghostbusters as well.

The CEO of Saber Interactive did write an opinion piece about Epic Store and why they went with Epic

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-04-moving-platforms-forward-in-an-epic-games-world

Some interesting statements in that article above:

&gt;Epic is the first company tо have a real chance to break what has amounted to a virtual pricing monopoly by the major digital game distribution platforms.

&gt;Obviously a strong feature set is important for a platform in the broadest sense, but for companies like mine, paying for features we don't need and that our end users don't want ultimately means compromises on development and unnecessary costs passed onto consumers.

&gt;more money in the pocket of a developer generally goes to one thing: making more and better games for players, and so the best deal for us is often the best deal for our audiences.

So basically we already knew that Saber wanted to help out with Epic's goals of hopefully change the PC gaming industry away from the 30% standard, as well as have a more curated store for better visibility of games on a store.  But with this video that someone released today, shows that Saber Interactive is fully in on helping with those goals.

It looks like it really have paid off for Saber Interactive though.  By around 6 weeks after the game launched they had over 700k in sales on the PC, which at that time was more sales than all their games on Steam combined in the life time of those games.  Saber Interative stated this about their PC sales

&gt;we always believed the game would find a good following on PC eventually. The surprise was just how quickly it happened, and how important Epic’s platform was in getting us there.

https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-war-z/epic-sales

Anyways, I just thought all of this was interesting.

(As to the video I am referencing at the beginning, I would rather not post it publicly since the person swears like a sailor who just hit his thumb with a hammer.  If you really want to see the video just PM me and I'll give you a link.)",Looks like Saber Interactive really do want to help Epic bring their goals to fruition.,1.0,1588567192.0,2020-05-05 04:39:52

I bought Borderlands 3 on April 8, downloaded it for sixteen days (yes, I didn't shut my PC down at all due to being busy after all this COVID-19 stuff), got to 51% because of my shitty internet downloading at 300 KBps max. I turned off my PC and it reset back to zero! Now, I know you guys have heard all of this before. I've done my research and this exact FEATURE of the WONDERFUL EG Launcher has apparently been around since its birth. So, knowing that I can't exactly fix this because apparently making a game launcher store temporary files while downloading is too hard to even think of, I decided to ask customer service for a refund because I can't even play the damn game I bought from them.

Of course, I knew that the refund policy states that it should be requested within 14 days after purchase, but considering the case that I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE DAMN GAME AT ALL, MEANING THAT THE REFUND ISN'T EVEN ABOUT THE ACTUAL GAME BUT COMPLETELY ABOUT THE TECHNICAL RETARDATION OF HOW THEY DEVELOPED THEIR LAUNCHER, I thought I'd get at LEAST sympathy for my troubles.

Long story short, nope. I learned two things: Epic Games knows how ridiculous they are because they don't even want their customer service to give even their real (OR FAKE) first name since the guy that handled my case is fucking named ""Kilo Bravo"". Their customer service barely even took note of what I described in my e-mail. 

I absolutely despise this fucking launcher and this company. Even emulators for mobile phones store temporary download files because it's 2020 and saving temporary data is not that hard.

TL;DR, fuck Epic Games.

I know that this is a question more for epic support and I already sent a ticket to them (which will take an eternity and half for them to reply-back), but I wanted to know what would happen if I de-linked the both the PS and xbox account to my epic account?

If it was the case that someone had gotten into my account I would have no problem de-linking everything. However, if this was a horrendous mistake, I'd rather not be a dick and delete all save data for this person.

When I bought Snowrunner it said $39.99 and made no mention of that price being in USD. When I got the PayPal receipt I was charged $58.51 CAD. I had to contact support to change my currency to Canadian dollars even when my account was already set to Canada. Now that it has been updated to reflect proper pricing I see the price is $43.99 CAD that's a difference of $14.52 CAD compared to what I was charged.. Contacted support again and asked for the difference in price to be refunded. I've been passed around to 3 different people who all thought I just want a full refund. The result so far has been ""contact your bank for currency conversion questions"". All I want is the difference in price refunded since this was an issue on their end but so far no luck.

When Unreal Tournament was in early alpha development, I created an account to be able to download and try it out. Since, I haven't really used Epic's services until a couple of days ago when I felt like checking out a game that was exclusive to the Epic Games launcher.

When browsing the store I noticed that the prices where like 60 000 something, which doesn't at all correlate to my local currency (SEK, which is about 1 USD = 9 SEK).

https://preview.redd.it/14t9xwl1wlv41.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=184a968ee1e093ecab598ab4dd5ccd42de34f259

Odd, I though, and I tried to open the account settings which sent me to a website where the language was... well, my guess was Chinese. At first I thought it was just a redirect to a scam site, but the URL was correct (as was the SSL certificate). After digging through the site I finally managed to swap the language to English. At the same time I found that my location was set to Korea.

https://preview.redd.it/11fxzuy2wlv41.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99c0de8f3137f1f90a0e2c932ef84f3ff5e105ce

Being unable to change the location in the settings, I contacted support. I explained that I was unable to purchase any games, and that I am in fact located in Sweden and not Korea and asked if they could fix the issue. The answer I got back was... well, you can read it below in full but basically they demanded a photo copy of my Passport or legitimate ID card. Sorry, but I'm not sending that to a complete stranger on the internet.

https://preview.redd.it/7u2ococ4wlv41.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fc9b0e9b25b97a917996b3652757d8242a16e86

I have no idea why my account was set to Korea in the first place, but I honestly don't understand why it would be significant to change it. In either case they could just check my IP and be done with it. Or check my billing information.

We had some back and forth and I got more and more frustrated about the whole ordeal. I made it clear that I was not going to send a copy of my Passport or ID. I wouldn't even send that to my bank, even less to some random customer support representative for Epic Games. I've watched enough scam videos to know that that's a really bad idea.

This was the last email I received:

My reply was simple:  
""Please delete my account. I'm done dealing with you.""

1587952366,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g8rc1o/borderlands_3_download_size_from_77gbs_to_208gb/,"Hi Guys,

I’ve tried search various forums and articles regarding the download size of Borderlands 3 for the past couple days but can’t find anything! I don’t have unlimited internet and so am concerned because I’ve attempted downloading the game several times but ran into the same issue. The game begins downloading and says that it will be a 77gb download. Then usually after a few gbs have downloaded it will jump up to a a much higher total. The first time it jumped from 77gbs to 150gbs. Then the second attempt it jumped from 77gbs to 208gbs. This doesn’t seem normal…

To add to my confusion, I’m currently running it perfectly fine on my own gaming computer, but wanting to reinstall on my other computer.

I just want to know if anyone else has encountered this and if so, if there is a fix or I just have to download whatever amount the game decided to ask me to download? The closest thing I can find to this issue is this thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d3uemp/borderlands\_3\_is\_now\_113gb\_for\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d3uemp/borderlands_3_is_now_113gb_for_me/) 

A few extra bits of information, I have reinstalled the Epic Games Launcher and this is an attempt at a fresh install as I have already tried copying the game files from my own computer to hers to no avail. The game verifies and then downloads a bit and then tells me the files are corrupted…

Anyhow, the lack of features concerns me. The EGL has been out for a long time now and yet lacks many user friendly options.

\- Can't ""rush"" a update or download with multiple things downloading.

\- No overlay when in-game, making it more awkward to invite or add friends.

\- Adding friends is harder than most places as if you don't have the EXACT name with capitalisation correct then you add the wrong person. Maybe add a friend code option?

\- No user reviews. I like to see the overall opinion on a game before downloading or buying. I understand they probably want to avoid ""Review Bombing"" but it ruins it for others.

\- See what friends are playing. When playing WWZ or For The King with a friend. On the friends list it has their status as ""Online"". The only two games I see a ""playing"" status on is Fortnite and Dauntless.

1587535916,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g5vvbh/why_i_am_an_epic_store_customer/,"- They introduce me to games that are really special.  Vast majority of my gaming is indie gaming, and I concentrate on games that I feel used creativity and/or innovation better than what you normally see. On Steam for a long time I have been having a really hard time finding those special games.  Sure I can find good games on Steam using their various search features, but they never really showed me something special, they showed me good games that were really not that much different than most anything else with in the same genre.  I need more than just being good, it needs to be good and have something special about it.  Epic has been doing a great job at curating their store and finding those special games.  I am also a GOG customer for the same reason.

- There is no forced updating of games. This is important for me.  I don't have any of the games auto updating, and I typically wait for 24 hours to see if there ended up being any reported major issues before doing the update.  I also like to mod games, and having forced updating can make a game become unplayable due to the mods not being compatible with the newest version of the game, so I wait to update until after the mods have been updated to work with the newest version. One suggestion I have is they create a way to roll back to previous versions, like GOG Galaxy does.

- They give much greater support to indie gaming due to things like the better revenue share and the Support a Creator program that helps with marketing.  This sets up the indie developers to have greater opportunity to make more money from their games that can then lead to a great opportunity for them to make even better games then they could before. GOG's affiliate program is one of the reasons why I am a customer of GOG.

- Epic doesn't have a DRM, let alone a free one, for the dev/pubs to use.  I do feel this entices most of the developers to not use DRM at all because they don't want to create and support one of their own or they don't want to buy one, especially since there is no actual proof that DRM is effective in increasing profits at all, but if there was one for free and it was easy to use they might as well as use it just in case, but that thought would be different when they have to actually spend money on the DRM.  So I am glad that Epic basically de-emphasizes the use of DRM. 

Those are my top reasons why I am an Epic Store customer. I really do feel between Epic and GOG that 2019 has been the best year in pc gaming for me in a long time.  And I am excited to see what Epic and GOG have in store for us throughout the rest of this year.",Why I am an Epic Store customer,,1587492716.0,2020-04-22 18:11:56

1587353072,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g4lbu8/alright_im_frustrated_with_epic_and_their_refund/,"Ok, I'm tossing this out here because I'm ticked off at Epic right now. So I purchased The Outer Worlds on PC and was excited as I love Bioshock and after watching gameplay for TOW it seemed to have that similar vibe. I bought it while it was on sale and I started playing it and admiring the world and characters that Obsidian had crafted. HOWEVER after about 20 minutes of playing the game it suddenly crashed on me taking me back to the desktop. No biggie, my comp is a little older now so I rebooted it back up. Dropped the settings just to be safe and started again. Lo and behold 20 minutes later the game not only crashed but it bluescreened my computer. Ok... 

After testing this game over and over again I realized it would not run on my computer at all regardless of the settings. Disappointed I left my computer to go make dinner. After coming back I decided that I would apply for a refund only to realize I accidentally left the game running on the title screen.

Basically what happened was I appealed to Epic asking for a refund because I didn't want to spend money on essentially nothing. I checked how much time I had spent in game I saw that I had spent 10 minutes over the allotted refund time for a game. However I had faith that Epic support would have a little sympathy for me, especially since most of that time was spent not with me afk. 

NOPE, they basically said suck it up buttercup and take your problems somewhere else. 

I've had a similar situation come up with Steam where I spent over 2 hours on the login screen of a game cause I was called away from my computer. However after I appealed to Steam support they kindly refunded me. 

I don't know, it just feels like they respect me less as a consumer even though I have little against Epic. I was one of the first to preorder BL3 when it became exclusive to the Epic store. I have sat through long update timers and slow changes to the store because I know these things take time. 

I would just like to be treated with a little human sympathy when it comes to these things.

The CEO of Epic Games has said that Tenecent does not have any influence on the company.

My question is, what would happen if Tenecent decided to sell their 40% of Epic Games? 

I'm don't have any kind of business degree, but if I'm not mistaken, if Tenecent sold their 40%, then Epic would be in a lot of financial trouble. 

I may be wrong, and Tenecent just owns 40% of the company and not 40% of the company's stock. But again, I don't have a business degree.

[Second Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/faewnm/tech_support_megathread/?sort=new)

**For those that don't know the initial Tech Megathread was created due to community demand. News was getting buried by tech issues and most issues posted just got buried even more. It was pretty miserable. So on 29-Jan-2020 we made it a rule to organize things in the megathead.** 

*Tech support questions and feedback are no longer allowed to be posted (as of 29-Jan-2020 - this was a community decision). Please post all your tech support questions on the Epic Games launcher, store and its games in the following megathread. Additionally, if it's game related, please check out PCGamingWiki as there may already be a solution to your problem!*

To find a Moderator made attempt at organizing some of these issues check out this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xg27xPCe2FO-5FhgB858tR6G57UC7ykwE9i68v_PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing). You can use the document outline to go to either launcher issues or game issues and this is fortunately much easier for mods to manage when we can. Please keep in mind only fixes that have seen a lot of promise are posted there.

Overall this is a community effort so if you have tech issues or questions about the launcher or it's games then post them here. For those that like helping keep in mind that I still sweep through and reward solutions that have been proven to work for people. We aren't from Epic or affiliated in any way but in the last 4 months this sub has grown by around 4000 people so organizing these things is more important than ever.

Thanks for your time and patience.

1587096840,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/g2urgy/just_cause_4_epic_games_version_graphic_settings/,"I've been doing heavy research and development on the graphic settings of Just Cause 4 for the past couple of hours both in game and from multiple other guides throughout the internet and thought I'd share the best settings that I've came up with for those that want to maximize performance without losing visual fidelity whatsoever.

These settings are my official locked settings.

* Screen Settings: Fullscreen
* Vertical Sync: No
* Anisotropic Level: 16x (max)
* Resolution: Native Resolution, 1440p (143Hz) for me
* Anti-Aliasing: OFF - Around 10 fps drop on SMAA, so go FXAA if you must use AA. I personally don't see much visual difference between the three settings because all the settings present jaggies. So I have it OFF. In 1080p this may look different so this setting is a setting to experiment with. I didn't notice much fps hit with FXAA on, maybe 2-5 fps, if that. Still like it OFF because I'm in 1440p.
* Texture Quality: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Water Detail: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Ocean Tessellation: Yes (turning this off drops 2-3 fps for some reason, leave it on)
* LOD Factor: Very High (max) Easy lock here.
* Shadow Quality: Very High (max) - Strangely this setting doesn't affect fps much at all, even on low. So a no-brainer to leave it on Very High. If you like less sharp shadows, try High but it's not going to impact fps, just that personal preference of less sharp(soft) shadows. Same at medium. So consider Very High as sharp, High as soft, Medium as softest and Low as garbage.
* SSAO: No - BIGGEST fps hit in the game, just turn it off. There's a couple reasons to turn this on imo. One, if you're a big fan of ambient occlusion in general. Those tiny shadow details on objects that make the game more realistic. And two, if you care more about this tiny detail than you do a good chunk of fps. My guess is around 9-13 fps, give or take. Hardware will differ of course.
* Motion Blur: No (personal preference, 1-2 fps impact with it on)
* Edge Fade: No (personal preference, zero impact on fps)
* Global Illumination: No (3-4 fps impact with it on) The visual difference of this setting may take more time to develop because I noticed no difference visually but in Just Cause 3, I did. Might turn this one on in the future if I find a visual difference. In Just Cause 3, the difference visually was basically sunlight bloom. Or just the heat that the sun causes, if that makes any sense.
* Screen Space Reflections: No (turning this on will drop around 3-5 fps) This is a setting many people may prefer to be ON because it basically puts reflections of mountains and what not in water. I personally want the extra fps boost but may decide to change my mind if I like what I see as I play the game turning it on and off in different areas of the game.
* Bokeh Depth of Field: No (personal preference, 1-2 fps impact with it on)

Side Note (apart from this graphic settings guide): One thing to note is that sometimes when first starting up the game, it seems laggy and presents screen tearing(no clue why but it's happened once for me on like 20 startups in the past hour). Not sure why this happens but I found the fix within a few minutes of tinkering around while it was happening. You simply change the resolution in the in-game settings from your native resolution/(Hz) to something lower, apply the settings. Then change it right back to where you had it. This fixes both the lagginess and screen tearing that sometimes is presented for some reason upon playing the game.

P.S. Hope everyone that isn't able to play the game due to the crashing get to play it asap. The devs are working on fixing the issue and hopefully will relay some info on what's going on with it. I know there's a workaround by just playing the game offline but still.",Just Cause 4 Epic Games Version Graphic Settings Guide,,1587053640.0,2020-04-17 16:14:00

If you calculate the size of the game downloaded, i'm downloading 1mo/s so it's good too !  
BUT : Why the download graph is wrong ?! It always say 0 to max speed at 100 kB/s.  
When you're new on EGS you say : This EGS is very slow !

I've been interested in playing DBH for ages now, and now that it's finally available on PC, I downloaded the demo in hopes to be able to buy the full version afterwards. However, even though my laptop meets the game's required specifications, it gives a warning at the startup of the demo. (I've attached pictures of both the warning and the specifications of my laptop compared to the ones required). I've tried multiple fixes - updating the NVIDIA driver, updating Windows, downloading Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 and so forth. The closest I've gotten to is agreeing to the license at the start of the game, but it immediately crashes after. 

I've tried it on my brother's computer, he's got a beast monitor so I figured it would work. We got the same warning, but the demo started and worked. His CPU was through the roof at the startup of the game (100%), but throughout playing it was down to around 8.0%. I think my laptop might not be able to handle the startup, but is perfectly able to handle the play-through. That's my guess...

It would mean the world if anyone would know any fix for it. Thanks in advance!

I’m really sick of all the Epic bashing that happens in most PC gaming communities so I thought this would be as good a place as any to do a giveaway. They are all Steam keys though unless noted otherwise.

**Write a comment with the game you want. Don’t send me pm:s asking for games since that will just get messy.** I will try to remove games from the list as they are taken, but **sort by new and search previous comments to see if a game has already been asked for**. I can't guarantee you'll get any game if yours has been mentioned in a previous comment.

**It’s first come, first serve and only one game per user to begin with.** If there are still keys left after two days or so then you can ask for another one.

If you remember, please let me know if you tried the game, no matter if you liked it or not. It’s nice to know that the keys are useful rather than just another game in someone’s backlog.

I’ll go with the RandomActsOfGaming rules: **Your account must be at least 30 days old and have a minimum of 150 comment karma to enter giveaways. Comment Karma must not be from giveaway subs only.** 

It will likely take me a while to send out all the keys so please be patient.

I learned pretty late about Epic's generosity, and had missed a lot of stuff. It's fine if they won't, but I would like to know if anyone knows for certain.


Also had suggestions for the EpicGames launcher
(my views)
The Home section could be removed in the launcher and I would not notice any difference. The store page is already a good home page. Maybe add a Community page under Library. If you wouldn't like to remove Home, you could remove the truly large pictures about upcoming news and just write them in an Article format instead. So one can simply click on the Title which will open a page with more information if you'd like to look more into it (and any pictures would be in this page). And at the bottom of the article, a comment section. This would make the launcher much cleaner I think. In the community section you could hold like weekly events so people visit the launcher more often (so more chances for a sale). An event could be the old snake not touching it's body game which records your score and shows a score list on the side of people with highest scores. Probably could add ads and stuff for games on sale that week on the side. Idk I'm making this up right now, but please do something about that Home page, the pictures are simply too large.

1586037123,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fv23d6/whoever_coded_epic_launcher_needs_to_actually/," I rarely play anything on Epic unless it's on sale or free. I booted it up after months of not touching it, it asks me to update, I choose yes. It updates. Then it asks me for my username and password. Why? I was already logged in before. After about 30 minutes of trying to figure out my account, I finally did, then noticed it wasn't showing the installed games: I moved the folders to a new drive, which should be simple to do on any other software. NOT HERE. So you can't verify, move or point to the location of the folder, you'd have to install the game over.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I tried these methods of editing text files and going into ProgramData folders and what not to no avail. Spent about as much time trying to move these folders as it would have took to just download it. So now, I have about six 50+ gig games waiting to download, that are actually on my disc anyway. Wasting a few hours to get stuff back that is once again, right on my HDD.

I never got an email or anything telling me the reason for my ban. I assumed it was an auto clicker I had on because I was playing cookie clicker. If any of you don't know what an auto clicker is, it's a script that just clicks for you. This may sound like cheating but with the way guns work in Fortnite, using an auto clicker would make the game worse. 

So anyways I decided I'll just send a support ticket. Took about 3 support tickets to get a response from a real human instead of an automated email saying ""If you can't login to your account try resetting your password."" They said they're unable to unban me because it's against their TOS. So I just say ok and deal with it. 

It's been 2 years and I decide to send another support ticket because I want to play with my console friends. They look into it and tell me they're unable to do a complete investigation this late into it and I should have sent a support ticket when I got banned. I explained to them that I did and they told me they can't help and are unsure on why they didn't help when I sent a support ticket earlier. 

I just want to be able to play the game with my friends on console and because of an auto clicker that I forgot to close and didn't even use I got banned. I can't even play the game on another account.

1585556749,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/frmz3k/world_war_z_first_impression/,"Played it for a few hours so I guess these are my thoughts on it

GRAPHICS: I like the graphics, it’s not too demanding yet not to cartoonish I guess. I think it’s pretty good and there really isn’t that much of a major difference when comparing low and high graphics, at lest for me.

ANIMATIONS: I have a few problems which bother me. 1. I feel the characters animations could have a bit more of a heavy feel to it. They carry all this stuff yet it doesn’t look like how a real human would run/walk with stuff like that. 
2. Honestly epic games, what’s up with the skeleton legs. The characters have way too big a gap in the croch area, and the leg and feet animations look dum and don’t feel real at all. They run with their legs and feet at an angle pointing out a little plus the gap it just makes it weird and unappealing
3. This is my preference, but I feel the aiming down site is way too fast. Games that do that give me this low quality feel. A gun is heavy, and I like it when it feels like you’re carrying a heavy gun. It should be slowed down a it. changing it according to different weapons would be great.
4. I hate how there are set things to what we can climb over. I don’t think that needs anymore explanation.

FEEL: This game has so much potential and I wish you guys would’ve given that but you didn’t. I expected a heart pumping/scary feel and vibe but I didn’t really get as much as I wanted. A darker look, more contrasty, more bass to the sounds would definitely improve it. But it’s just missing something.
I don’t like when the characters just stand in front a helicopter and then it cuts to a scene. I wanna see them get it in. Stuff like that’s gives it good feel.

OVERALL THOUGHTS: I know it’s a free game, but why take this awesome idea and give it a half ass feel, half ass fun, half ass action, half ass everything.

I would rather pay for this game that has everything it needs to make it just right, fun, and awesome. It was a waste of an idea you guys took, especially from an amazing movie which got my hopes up for this game. 

It’s a fun game don’t get me wrong but it has soo much more potential. It’s like building you’re a son a 6 wheel LEGO car, but then you only put 4 and give it to him. You didn’t give the full package, it was missing crucial parts to make it more enjoyable.",World War Z First impression,,1585513549.0,2020-03-30 21:25:49

I'll just write my scenario out in a few steps, probably the easiest to understand:

1. I had been abroad for a couple of months and didn't have much access to my emails
2. Returned a few weeks back, to discover I had numerous emails asking to verify my email account (seems someone had tried to get in).
3. Tried to login to change my password, unfortunately I get a message saying *Sorry your account is inactive and may not login*, I check this out and apparently it means I'm banned, probably the hacker was up to some shady stuff (?).
4. Tried to reset my password. I get the link in an email to reset my password and it's in Spanish (I'm not Spanish and did not have my epic games account set up in Spanish - clearly the hacker has succeeded in accessing my account), following the link and resetting the password results in the same message as above.
5. Sent a couple tickets over the last few weeks, the second being today. I'm getting no response from customer services, I would have thought even with the crisis going on globally today I would get some response within a few weeks.

Is there a phone number for these guys or a better way to get this sorted e.g. a direct chat or something (I can't seem to find any other way to contact them)? I really don't want to lose all my games and the money I've spent just because it seems impossible to contact them.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

But today I received an email from epic telling me that I need to give them the following information to proceed with the refund:

- Id of the purchase
- Email address associated with your Epic Games account 
- Current Epic Games account display name 
- First and last name of Epic Games account holder 
- Any external accounts currently connected to your Epic Games account (if applicable) --This includes Google, Facebook, Twitch, PSN, XBL, and Nintendo accounts --Please include the platform and display name of any external accounts

Now my question is, is it necessary to send them this info since I can already see that I have gotten a refund on my PayPal?

It's also worth mentioning that I had played the game for 5 hours which is obviously more than the 2 hours threshold required for me to be eligible for a refund so I'm guessing that this is a special case.",A question about refunding,,1585347253.0,2020-03-28 23:14:13

So as the title says, today I installed for the first time the Epic Games Launcher, and I immediately ran into the issue of it getting stuck on ""Preparing the Epic Games Launcher"" (and actually, after waiting for a while, it just goes back to the identification screen).

I looked it up and found this thread discussing it : [https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/dwmqf1/epic\_games\_launcer\_hangs\_at\_preparing\_the\_epic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/dwmqf1/epic_games_launcer_hangs_at_preparing_the_epic/)

&amp;#x200B;

Tried deleting the Epic folder in ProgramData as advised, before installing it again. Still the same issue. Someone in the comments says to go to the Manifests folder - except I don't even have it ! At that location, I only have a folder called EMS and a file called Launcher.manifest.

I even saw a tweet by epic games on this issue : [https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1204059777917227009](https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1204059777917227009)

Except the link they gave is now broken ! What the hell, did they just delete the solution to the problem after a while ?

So yeah, I'm kind of stuck now, has anyone been in my situation ? Do you have any ideas on how to proceed ?","""Preparing the Epic Games Launcher"" Issue - tried everything, still doesn't work",,1585179608.0,2020-03-27 00:40:08

Recently i bought AC:Odyssey with holiday coupon but my friend wanted to get Satisfactory so we can play together. I requested a refund and asked them if i will get the coupon back. They told me that i will get a NEW holiday coupon and I shouldn't WORRY about it.

After refund, they are saying that it was a misinformation and i won't get a coupon back.

So, be careful if you are refunding a game that you used a coupon. You will not get your coupon back, even tho it says otherwise in website and customer support confirms it.

IF I RETURN THE GAME I PURCHASED USING THE $10 EPIC COUPON, WILL THE COUPON BE RETURNED TO MY ACCOUNT?

The game launches, even from Uplay, it gets past the Ubisoft logo animation and the copyright info with the ""Don't close the game when this save icon comes up"" screen.

It gets to the Watch Dogs start screen with the ""Press Any Key"" prompt. I've pressed every key on the IT layout keyboard, it gets to a black screen with the cursor on the upper-left side, drops down to 30 FPS (monitoring with RivaTuner) and then nothing. Game doesn't start, and when I alt-tab out the window, I cannot alt-tab back in, and I have to kill the process in task manager.

System:

* CPU: Ryzen 5 3600
* GPU: ASUS GeForce RTX 2060 Turbo
* RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x8 GB 3200MHz
* SSD: Samsung EVO 860 250GB
* HDD: Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200RPM (game installed on this drive)
* MOBO: MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max

Currently, I've tried:

* Re-Installing the game
* Veryfing the files
* Launching from Uplay
* Launching from EGL
* Launching from bin/Watch\_Dogs.exe
* Compatibility with Windows 7 and 8
* Running the game as Admin
* Moving the game to SSD

The game apparently needs to be ran through ubisoft's launcher. Luckily, it appears that everything's been downloaded all you have to do is run the game manually to prompt the ubi launcher to install (small download relative to the game itself)

1. Find where your game was installed (/c/somepath/epic/watchdogs)
2. Rename the watchdogs folder to Watch\_Dogs
3. go into Watch\_Dogs/bin and run Watch\_Dogs.exe
4. Ubisoft will load, prompting you to log in
5. Ubisoft will ask you to choose your location to install
6. Select /c/somepath/epic (it automatically appends /Watch\_Dogs because dumbness)

1584407666,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fjwdrs/epic_quality_of_life/,"Here are the majority of quality of life features that are currently on the way to Epic Games...

1. **Mod Support** \- Players will be able to browse a catalog of player and developer made mods for their games. Players will be able to auto-install mods into games they own, that are managed by the Epic Games launcher or download the files separately for other games.
2. **Self-Service Refunds** \- The ability for players within the refund policy guidelines to be able to self-serve refunds without having to contact Player Support.
3. **Price-Adjusting Bundles** \- Bundles that dynamically adjust their pricing based on whether the player already owns parts of the bundle.
4. **Achievements** \- An Achievement service for titles on the Epic Games store.
5. **Additional Payment Methods** \- Additional local payment methods for many regions.
6. **Additional Currencies** \- Support for a variety of local currencies.
7. **Social Overhaul** \- General overhaul of Social Features (for example friends) to improve speed and stability of service.
8. **Newsfeed and Follow Improvements** \- Enable players to follow games; giving them more control over their newsfeed.
9. **Gifting** \- The ability to gift games to other Epic users.
10. **Direct Carrier Billing** \- The ability to buy games with direct carrier billing.
11. **User Reviews** \- Developers can enable player reviews on game pages.
12. **Shopping Cart** \- A shopping cart for the store.
13. **?** \- Additional quality of life feature you hope for.
14. **?** \- Additional quality of life feature you hope for.
15. **?** \- Additional quality of life feature you hope for.

What is **your** order(1-15 above) in which you'd like to see such features arrive sooner vs later(1 being sooner) and briefly explain how each feature may or may not benefit gamers.

Here, I'll go first...

1. **Live Technical Support/Customer Service** \- I feel like if this existed at Epic, thousands upon thousands of gamers would be very happy campers and it would be a key factor in holding true to the name Epic. I'd imagine a set of hours would be necessary. Maybe Monday through Saturday, Lunchtime to Night time? Some type of 8 hour period would suffice(imo).
2. **Mod Support** \- Change things dramatically within my games? Count me in.
3. **Additional Payment Methods** \- Being able to pay with something other than money would be awesome. I've got some antiques I've been trying to get rid of for so many years.
4. **Rewards System** \- Some type of rewards system. How it works really wouldn't matter as long as you get to earn things. You could even make the earning of things an insanely grindy process. If it exists, I'm all about earning things. To even hear about the types of things(aside from games obviously), that I could earn, sound super exciting.
5. **User Reviews** \- I think this would create something very interesting for gamers to do with a lot of their time inside their Epic libraries and I think it should be mandatory for gamers to be able to comment on every single review(unlike Steam giving reviewers an option to allow comments). Sure people will disagree with me here but I cannot stand not being to speak my mind on Steam reviews that have disallowed comments. What good is a review if you cannot discuss over it? It'll just get buried and go unnoticed(imo).
6. **Social Overhaul** \- Different social features? Yes please.
7. **Price-Adjusting Bundles**  \- I own around 100 Epic games. Even though I've only purchased one game for $5.00, this would obviously come in handy.
8. **Achievements** \- I was an achievement hunter for many years and I can understand exactly what this would bring to the table. Gives people a sense of accomplishment and reward for playing games, thus giving them more encouragement to play said games.
9. **DRM Free Games** \- I have this one around half way because I'm not exactly sure on how Epic would go about making this happen and how it might affect things for everyone. I do feel like a lot of people would want to play their games offline though and this would allow them to do that.
10. **Newsfeed and Follow Improvements** \- I'm just not much into following games within my Epic newsfeed. I didn't even know I had an Epic newsfeed. This one does however earn a spot at number 8 because I feel it might somehow be of interest to me if it already needs an improvement and is in the development of being improved.
11. **Additional Currencies** \- I only use one currency so that's the only reason this is so far down on my list because I'd imagine this would benefit a lot of people in other countries.
12. **Gifting** \- I suppose this would be nice for those that have no method of sending money to fellow gamers.
13. **Direct Carrier Billing** \- I dunno what this even is so for that reason it's this low on my list.
14. **Self-Service Refunds** \- I've never had to get a refund for a game since I've been alive so this one won't benefit me much.
15. **Shopping Cart** \- No comment.",Epic Quality of Life,,1584364466.0,2020-03-17 14:14:26

1584214828,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fio63r/help_unfold_games_get_darq_on_egs/,"So just some background facts on the situation. It's important to note that Epic was a brand new shop with no relationship with Unfold.

Epic approached Unfold about DARQ for exclusive release on EGS. Unfold inquired about non-exclusive release. Epic made it clear that it wasn't a possibility, but only in the meantime. They also made it clear that it will be a possibility in the future as their shop opens up. They gave a bit more detail about their offer, and invited Unfold to meet for a video chat.

This entire interaction between Unfold and Epic only occurred within no more than few terse emails.

OK so starting as a new shop in a very closed market. It doesn't matter how big Epic is, Steam has indescribable control over the PC game market. Yes Epic's intent is to open up to indi developers. EVENTUALLY. But they absolutely cannot be expected to do much in their early stages while having to get their foot into the door of an impossible market.

Their offer to Unfold at that point in time does not mean they will not open up in the future for unknown devs that they have no relationship with. This makes all the sense in the world. So yes, Epic is excellent for indi devs. But they need some time to grow in the market first. It doesn't matter who you are. They cannot help you at that point in time when they need to be following a standard growth plan.

It gets so much better. So Unfold and Epic went ahead to have a genuine meeting face to face meeting right? Obviously, personal meetings are extremely important. Not just for negotiating and discussing offers. You build a relationship with somebody. Ask each other questions about themselves and their company. Actually, get a feel for one another.

But definitely, find out more about Epic's offer. And find out what Epic really has to say about what they can do in regards to DARQ as a non-exclusive simultaneous release. As in a face to face decision, with information, and Epic's perspective on it.

Wrong. This didn't happen. No in-person meeting. No video meeting. Not even a phone conversation. Unfold rejected Epic right then and there. With no further discussion beyond those initial few terse emails. So rather than communicating with Epic face to face to actually get a better understanding of Epic's decision and perspective, what did Unfold do? They went behind Epic's back, onto the internet. They went on a mad rant making extremely abusive comments at Epic. Including outright lies. Well, needless to say, the lunatic trolls and cyberbullies took off with that. This was later followed by a Tweet from Unfold about donating to charity if Epic accepts them. WTF?

OK so Epic states something completely reasonable in an email. New shop. Cannot currently work with new devs for simultaneous release. No problem. Focused on the exclusive thing to help grow the shop. And blatantly even stated they will open up in the future for devs. Epic even extends an invitation to meet with them in video chat.

So let's not be professional. Let's not actually talk to Epic to their face, and try to get a better understanding of their decision. Let's not find out what Epic can do for getting DARQ listed in the future when their shop opens up more. Let's not choose understanding and communication. No don't do that. Let's choose ignorance, let's deny any genuine discussion, let's jump to mad conclusions, let's post a tantrum rant about it on the internet. Let's not actually actually reach out to Epic like human beings to see what they can do about listing DARQ simultaneously. No. Let's post a meaningless comment on Twitter.

From start to finish, Epic hasn't done a single thing at all that anybody can say remotely unprofessional or in the wrong. Epic has been 100% up front and honest about everything they said. There is clearly an extreme breakdown in communication here. And it's 1000% not on Epic's end. If I was in Epic's shoes, I'd be asking wtf is this dude talking about?

So where to go from here? For whatever reason, not Unfolds fault this time, there was some miscommunication a few months ago when initially trying to get more information from them. I've recently been in contact with them.

The intent is obviously to get DARQ on EGS. Something I am certain, everybody would love to see happen for them. Despite whatever they did in the past. Which anybody with half a brain, can see why it wouldn't be very effective.

The fact of the matter is that there has never been any sort of actual genuine discussion between Unfold and Epic about listing DARQ as a non-exclusive. It never even happened. No overt decision or anything that can be reasonably identified as conclusive on the matter.

Unfold's game = only Unfold's responsibility to take the initiative to reach out to Epic. I've personally suggested to him to get in touch with the owner, and get him on the phone. As in don't discuss anything at all outside of at least a phone conversation, if not some form of actual face to face meeting.

Now this entire post would be about contacting Epic to make it happen. But really, the ball is not in Epic's court in this case. The only one holding the game back from getting released in EGS at this point is Unfold. So if anybody has a complaint about DARQ not being on EGS, as it stands, it's not Epic you should be complaining to.

Please contact Unfold. Let them know you would like to see DARQ on EGS. And I repeat, they have not actually spoken to Epic about it as of yet. Meaning, if there has been no legitimate discussion with Epic to list DARQ, anybody claiming it's Epic that is preventing it, is outright lying.

Hi there.

I have a coupon left over from that sale in December (?) last year and I need to use it before 1st of May.

I am thinking about using it on Watch Dogs since it is listed as a free game for next week. Past experience has shown me that claiming the standard edition of a game when Epic offers it for free does not allow me to get an upgraded edition of the game. I am only allowed to get the DLC's/season pass. However, the coupon is not valid for purchasing a season pass.

Should I wait until after the free week to use it? On that matter, do you think the upgraded edition (with all extra content) will be 14.99 or above?",How to best use my coupon,,1584040407.0,2020-03-13 20:13:27

1582756106,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/fa1ldc/guide_on_how_to_install_ubisoft_games_through/,"I am seeing a lot of people having issues with Ubisoft games. So I'm gonna walk you through step by step exactly what you are supposed to do. I am gonna go into as much detail as possible and adress all the issues.

However before we start PLEASE make sure Epic and Uplay are both installed out of C Drive. DO NOT INSTALL ANY GAME LAUNCHER IN C DRIVE IT CAUSES A LOT OF ISSUES.

##After you buy the game open the launcher and go to your library. The game you purchased should be there.

1. It should say ""Ubisoft Login Required"". This happens for each game and is NOT a one time process. You will have to verify each game you purchase and link it to your Ubisoft account.

2. If it says ""Install"" before ""Ubisoft Login Required"" then the launcher is bugged. You should close and restart. If it still stays bugged then close it again and keep restarting. Try to restart your PC. If the problem still persists then simply shut down and wait for half an hour. Open Epic and then it should say login required. This is VERY important. If you install without Ubisoft login the game WILL NOT work.

3. Once you click login it will open a small window which will then open your browser. You need to connect your Ubisoft account to Epic for the first time but after that it just goes through 2 pages and then tells you its done and you can close the browser. Close the browser only and only when it says you can. On some occasions it just won't work and I have had that problem. Simply try to do the process again and close the browser only after it says you can.

Once the process is successful the ""Install"" icon should appear and now the game should also be in your Uplay library.

##Now you have two options. 

1. Download the game through Epic. It'll download the game, when its finished it'll simply open Uplay and boom the game is downloaded. You have to do nothing. The game downloads and installs itself through Uplay. 

2. You can skip Epic and simply download through Uplay as well.

I use Epic to download since speed is much faster. For AC Odyssey I had to download additional 20gb after a 72gb download on Epic(it was a 109gb download through Uplay). But this was only Odyssey and no other game downloaded extra after downloading through Epic.

That's it. If you followed this properly then enjoy.","Guide on How to ""Install"" Ubisoft games through Epic! I have been seeing too many people having problems so here is how you solve them!",,1582712906.0,2020-02-27 11:28:26

Forget the EGS, just go to directly to Uplay. Make sure to run it as admin so you validate the files.

1. Run Uplay as Admin

2. Go to Syndicate

Unity was already free last year when Notre Dom was burnt, Ubisoft was giving it away. So I guess its already done once and not like the game is making them much money anyways.

However for Epic it would be a great chance to gather even more customers by giving away one of the biggest AC games.

Another reason it makes me hopeful is because recently all of the Far Cry games were added to Epic but none of the AC games are on sale on it, except obviously Odyssey(and AC 3 Remaster which is bundled with it) and Origins.

So I guess they mostly would put the rest of the AC games on their store what better way than a giveaway.

\-----

Like the poster below I bought an Ubisoft game from the Epic Store.  The Division 2 downloaded through Epic, a good 50GB or so.   Then I needed to link accounts with Ubisoft.   That all worked fine, but when trying to launch the game from the Epic Launcher nothing happened. 

I am a Steam controller user, so I then went into Steam to add the game as a Non-Steam game.  There were three files I found and tried, and the one named EACLaunch actually booted up Uplay.   

Inside Uplay however, opening The Division 2 began a completely new download of the game.   I cancelled, and found that you can search for the game if it is already installed.   I pointed Uplay to the folder in /programfiles/epicgames/thedivision2 - But it said I'd need to redownload the game. 

Anyhow, just to save somebody else some time I post here.   It would have been super annoying to me if I was waiting hours for the download to complete just to see I needed to do it again.

Is it safe to ""uninstall"" the Epic Games Launcher version now that it's installed in the Uplay directory or will it uninstall that version as well? I really don't want that to happen because I have a slow Internet connection so downloading it again would take a long time.

Excuse me? I'm getting an ""Access Denied"" from you servers and your answer is: check with your ISP??? Oh please!

So I opened another ticket, 'cause... well it was clearly saying don't reply below this line.

(Unhappy customer trying to be polite)

First off, this is not a network issue. Someone from another ticket told me it's a network error. It's not. My network is fine.

I bought this game and now I'm getting access denied when launching it. I want my game ; PERIOD.

Now to the description of the issue:

I'm getting Access Denied error LS-0021 when trying to launch borderlands 3. It worked a few days ago.

It that helps, I just changed my cpu but my hardrive (including any previous installation) haven't changed.

I suspect that your licensing is based on hardware validation and thus changing the cpu invalidated the license. Please look into that possibility before pulling some random nonsense from your script.


Looking forward to actual help!

Hey *****,

Thanks for taking the time to reach out to us. I hope that you're doing fine, I'm ****** and I will be your support for this issue.

Thank you for providing the file that my colleague requested; however, it appears that it's in a zipped file. In order for me to be able to help you further, kindly attached the file again but this time, please make sure that the files were unzipped.

Thank you for your cooperation.

At this point I'm pissed off. So I just send the files unzipped.


Hopefully someone from Epic Games will read this and improve how their support team handle paying customers. 

By the way, AMD sent me a redeem code for Borderlands 3 so I don't really care. My plan was to give it to a friend but I guess I'll just waste it on me... I'm not sure...

When I goto Steam I see it like a massive store with a huge range of games and there is an excitement knowing there are hidden gems there (even if i cba to check), there is great value in this mindset and this is something Epic totally fails in.  When I check the Epic launcher there is almost nothing I want, i can see all the games in a minute and the variety is non-existent.  Origin and Uplay have more games.

The curation on Steam works via the sales system, this is what I almost always check exclusively when I goto Steam now (I have bought so many games in sales that I haven't even played half of them).  When I goto the Epic store I try to do the same thing, and after I see those 1-2 games on sale I leave.  After that I have really no reason to check again for weeks or months, I've seen your entire catalogue.

Aside from everything else, the massive amount of games also means the publishers want attention and so offer more sales to get into that sales curation tab.  They have no reason to do that on Epic and so remain greedy, even with Epic taking a smaller cut they still sell at full price.

The only reason EGS is relevent at all is free games and forced exclusives, the moment you stop these things your store will die very quickly","Epic thinks less choice is more, this is a mistake",,1581539505.0,2020-02-13 21:31:45

i've been a fan since the first UT that i played when i was younger, i liked your pumped up, tough characters and your gameplay styles even if i didn't have the opportunity to play some of your games because i only own a PC.  
I recently heard that you acquired Easy Anti-Cheat, and ceased all the development regarding Linux and i think i speak for all the linux community when i say that this makes us really sad (and angry!!!!) as all the games that require EAC are unplayable and inaccessible for us.

Since the beginning of the videogame industry us gamers had a passion that unites us all, and that is playing videogames. Please, let us enjoy and play your games on Linux platform, because even if we are a small group compared to the others, we are gamers.

(Also personally looking forward to the revival of Unreal Tournament development).

Sincerely,

the Linux gaming community.",An open letter regarding EAC,,1581417087.0,2020-02-12 11:31:27

1581362044,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/f1v6s2/epic_game_store_refusing_to_refund_preorders/," So I contacted Epic Game Store support to get a refund on a pre-order I made a while ago, game ain't out yet and probably won't be for a while (Vampire : The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2).

Their response? : 

&gt;Thank you for providing the requested information.   
   
&gt;  
&gt;We do apologize, your purchase is not eligible for a refund due to one of the following reasons:  
   
&gt;  
&gt;\--You exceeded the two-hour in-game time limit  
 \--You requested a refund after the 14-day refund time limit  
   
&gt;  
&gt;We ask for your understanding on this matter and it is highly appreciated. If you have further specific concerns, please feel free to contact us again. 

 Again, this is for a pre-order. Their refund policy clearly states that pre-orders can be refunded at any time before the game is released (that includes beta). Yet, Bloodlines 2 has to yet have beta AFAIK and is obviously not released, and they won't respect their own policy. See the exchange below.

I was able to move my character over to my real Epic Games account with Dauntless player support's help, but now my Switch only displays the ""fake"" Epic Games account on the Dauntless title screen asking me to link it again... I can't delete that Epic Games account because I never really logged into Epic's site and created it in the first place. So how the heck can I delete it?

I contacted Epic via their support site and they just send an auto reply asking for my email address but I never gave them one for this auto-generated account!

\-I've updated Windows, Microsoft Visual C++, NVIDIA Graphic Card drivers (Version: 441.87 - Release Date: Mon Jan 06, 2020 )

\-I've tried starting the game from NVIDIA Geforce Experience.

\-I've tried starting the game as an administrator, both with the Epic Games Launcher and DetroitBecomeHuman.exe

1580564739,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ex6bj6/in_some_ways_achievementstrophies_are_more/,"Although achievements aren't always a priority for PC gamers, they can add a lot more replay value to some games which are usually only played once, then put down forever. This might not always be important to the average game, but adding achievements to a game like ""collect all journals"", or ""play the game on hard, normal &amp; easy"" can be an incredibly simple method of keeping people coming back to your game for that 100% reward, which could be very appealing to many publishers, especially with the 88% cut.

This is very noticeable with PSN trophies, as players have a level they can maintain and a platinum trophy to achieve, after reaching 100%. This makes playing a game for longer, or for multiple playthroughs, a lot more appealing to players who like to get the most out of a game.

I think it would be even better if the platform added profile backgrounds &amp; game profile picture rewards, as an incentive for players to unlock 100% of achievements (after the store adds social features of course).

If achievements are done right, and quickly, then it could give the platform a massive advantage over other PC platforms, due to how simple achievements are on PC currently.","In some ways, achievements/trophies are more important than even a shopping cart, if Epic want to attract more publishers/developers to its platform, and compete with others.",,1580521539.0,2020-02-02 02:45:39

Essentially, I've noticed that I need to use a janky workaround in order to force the Epic Games Launcher to use the copy of my game; which I already have installed on my portable HDD (in this case the game is Borderlands 3). If Epic Games were to implement a feature into their launcher which recognizes and makes playable the games one has previously installed, that would be very much appreciated!

In other words, if I were to boot up steam on my laptop and then plug in my USB HDD (in that order). I can go to the settings menu and select my USB HDD, once done, steam would then recognize them as ""installed"" and let me play them immediately. The Epic Games Launcher NEEDS this feature as well.

&amp;#x200B;

two days ago i got a new ssd and i installed win10 + everything on it including epic game launcher.

on my old win10 install i got all the free games from epic game launcher so far. i installed all of them the day they where available. i deinstalled all the games but in my library i was able to see all the games greyed out and i was able to reinstall. after my new win10 install and new launcher install i wasn't able to reinstall my games. there was no icons in my library. the only game i was able to install was subnautica. this game was the only on i never installed (because i didnt installed it in the first week it was free and the next week it was gone from my library... so i was never able to install it afterwards. therefore i imediatelly install all free games and uninstall them afterwards so they stay in my library).

so.. after new install all free games are gone?

luckily i had my old win10 install on my old ssd.

i copied the whole ""EpicGamesLauncher"" folder located in:

C:\\Users\\ $ USER $ \\AppData\\Local

from my old win10 installation into the new win10 installation. this fixed the problem with the missing game icons in my library.

I tried reinstalling the app, no effect. Remembered someone suggesting tweaking Compatibility Settings &gt; High DPI Behavior, no effect. Tried running as admin, not sure what I expected to change but no effect.

I *did* contact their support... and they said that the problem is that my processor is 1.60 ghz when the requirement is 2.5. But that doesn't sound like it's related at *all* to what I'm dealing with... It's not about processing speed when a static UI is this broken... right??? Am I wrong to be confused about this?

Is there anyway to show that to Epic, as they are refusing my refund based on I have played it for over the two hours, I have tried to explain that playing is different than the game constantly crashing.

But, nope, they refuse to refund.  

Local citizens advice suggest a charge back - but if I do that,  will Epic close my account, and I’ll lose access to my other two games?

Fortnite players will soon be able save lives rather than end them thanks to a new creative gaming mode. The LifeRun update will see players take the role of ""International Red Cross heroes"" that take part in life saving missions in the hugely popular video game. The new creative mode will be debuted at the PAX South 2020 gaming festival in Texas on 17 January, with streaming star Ben 'DrLupo' Lupo among the first to demo it.

Fortnite developer Epic Games first introduced the creative mode to the game in 2018, allowing players to create custom maps and mini games. Epic Games is yet to reveal more details about the LifeRun mode, though company founder Tim Sweeney hinted it is all part of Fortnite developing from a game into a platform. He said on Twitter this would bring ""more powerful Fortnite Creative tools so that creators outside of Epic can do the kinds of things with the game that only we can do right now"".

Fortnite did not respond to a request for comment on LifeRun but does not typically provide much information about unreleased features and modes. On Friday, the game's developers unveiled the Chapter 2 Season 1 Overtime Challenges, which allow players to earn rewards for completing the missions.

""You may have met the alter egos of Remedy and others, but it appears that more alternative forms exist,"" Fortnite explained in a blog post announcing the new challenges. ""Unlock these new forms by completing Overtime Challenges."" New styles include the 'Remedy vs Toxin Outfit', the 'Medaxe Pickaxe', and the 'Antidote Back Bling'.

There is no way around this: I tried using the command line hack but it still complained about not being connected to the store.

I was really tired last night and got an email on my iPhone mail app about a requested password reset for epicgames which said to click to reset even if I didn’t ask for the reset. I wasn’t thinking and clicked. 

It took me to cloudfare? I usually get that when something isn’t working. I closed the tab and realized it was a fake.

I googled the epicgames site, reset my password on there and then later decided to delete the account because I didn’t need it anyways. I noticed the fake email was licensed only to 2019... I read something about epicgames having an issue last year which sounds like it was fixed? I’m wondering if that phishing email was one of those even though I recieved it last night or something new altogether. 

Should I be worried? I didn’t type any info into the fake email since it took me to cloudfare but that’s not reassuring. I also reset my email password just to be safe.

1578254386,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/eki5pt/why_doesnt_epic_make_their_store_better/,"I just don't get it. I really, really love what the Epic Games Store is doing, and I have so many great games because of them either being free or a lot cheaper. But, I just don't get why they don't improve their store.

For example, my little brother wanted Subnautica: Below Zero. It was half the price on Epic as it is on Steam, so I wanted to get it there. But, somehow, Epic doesn't have product gifting? that's just so weird to me, and I had to physically go to his computer and buy it for him, which is not an option for most gifting.

If Epic fixes their store, it would easily nullify a lot of people's problems with it. They'd still find something to hatejerk about, but it would be something!

Things they need to fix/add (feel free to add more):

- Game gifting

- Shopping cart

- Wish list

- Game reviews

- Reduce the processing power/internet/memory that the launcher uses (not a problem for all users, but my friend cites this as one reason he doesn't like it)

- Mods (not sure if this is possible)

- Better support for other countries, in the form of local currency and fee waiving (some countries, like those in Eastern Europe, have extra fees on Epic that they don't have on Steam)

- Customer support is iffy sometimes

- Cloud saving

I really wish Epic could succeed more, because Steam definitely isn't a perfect platform either. I just don't get why they don't even seem to be trying to improve the storefront.",Why doesn't Epic make their store better?,,1578211186.0,2020-01-06 08:59:46

It was in my junk folder and my email was telling me it was a possible phishing scam. I checked the email address and it added up though. I had a receipt yesterday for the free game by the same address, unless you can disguise your email now.

It said in the email that if you didn't request this you should follow the reset options, which I thought also sounded sketchy as every other password reset in the past had just told me to ignore it, as obviously you only need an email address to request one. I decided to check the link and the website address in my bar was exactly as written in the title. 

Looks legit but almost seems fishy with the ""manager"" part being tricky to tell. Dumb me had just woke up and seeing a log in page I forgot it was meant to be a ""password reset"" and so I did my muscle memory habits to start logging in. When I saw my 2FA, I remembered this wasn't the proper site to log in and I exited out of there&gt;

Immediately I went to actual Epic for the password reset and made an entirely clean new one (I don't use my Epic password for anything else, so fortunately I'm safe, I hope). On that email it simply said ""Click the button to reset your password for your Epic Games account."" with none of that other nonsense.

Not sure if this was legit or if this was a well off scam that my sleepy self almost fell for, but I figured it'd be better to be shared just to help inform anyone else. If this is just me being stupid and is legit, well then please just remove this and I'll at least feel more ease.","Possible scam reset password scam?""http://epicgamesmanager.com/"" a fake address?",,1577935815.0,2020-01-03 04:30:15

- Reinstating the directx files.

There is a lot of features going to be implement to the launcher and at the end of the 2020, I believe EGS is going to be a solid platform, hopefully. Until then it should have a great selection of devs and publishers on the line by then. Although, it seems like they won't accept games widely until they think EGS is grounded.

Also it's great to know that EGS has a quality standards that it will keep doors closed to any bad quality of games according to an interview with Tim Sweeney on PC Gamer.

""We'll have a quality standard that doesn't accept crappy games. We'll accept reasonably good quality games, of any scale, whether small indie games to huge triple-A games, and we'll take everything up to, like, an R-rated movie or an M-rated game. A GTA game would be fine to us, but Epic's not going to distribute porn games or bloatware or asset flips, or any sort of thing that's meant to shock players.""

1577795407,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ei2a4l/i_wish_developers_and_publishers_were_a_little/,"After the summer sale fiasco, where some developers/publishers raised the prices of their games to “compensate” for the Epic-subsidized discount (most notably, Supergiant Games, with then-exclusive Hades), or simply removed their titles from the store (Bethesda, with Borderlands 3), I expected that pathetic situation to never happen again. 

And yet, here we are, at the final hours of the holiday sale, with dozens of games strategically discounted to prices that sit right below the promo’s minimum of $14.99 (or the local currency equivalent in my country, at least), as to escape from the $10 coupon’s threshold.

Back in the summer, the excuse given by devs and publishers, for following through with those anti-consumer practices, was that Epic didn’t give them a heads-up regarding the sale or the promotional discount, even if they were still getting the same cut as if we were paying full price.

Then, the discussion shifted towards the perceived value of games, and how selling them at highly discounted prices is actually damaging to their image. 

To that, my friends, I say: [horseshit](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40691-018-0128-2).

If a dev/publisher can manage to discount their game to $14.98, they can obviously sell it for a cent more. However, that would make it possible for consumers to purchase it for $10 less than that. And, in the minds of devs/publishers, an even lower price would somehow impact the consumers’ perception of the quality of their product, which, as demonstrated by the study linked above, is simply false.

In reality, they’re missing out on actual sales because they’re too proud to have another company eat the costs of a promotion. Instead of accepting Epic’s generous terms for covering the costs of the coupon’s discount, and potentially put their games into the hands of more people, generating more word of mouth while making the exact same amount of money, they chose to be contemptuous and risk making 0 dollars. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada.

Regardless of the consumers’ satisfaction with the actual product, the gesture of allowing the use of a coupon, by itself, generates enough goodwill to offset most minor issues. Positive Steam reviews that are still critical of certain elements of games often mention their low prices as justification for the “thumbs up”.

As for myself, I simply avoided purchasing any titles that were purposefully discounted as to avoid being compatible with the $10 coupon. Devs/publishers with games on sale for $14.95, $14.50, $14.27... you’re not fooling anyone.

P.S.: Shoutout to Frogwares Games for not pulling a fast one and discounting The Sinking City to $17.09.

1577730638,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ehpw1d/those_bloody_coupons/,"I assumed when I saw other people having problems with them that they were just unlucky. Maybe I am too, because the following happened:

1. Claimed $10 coupon
2. Bought Satisfactory (don't, it's fucking shit) for $16.99
3. Missed Shadow Tactics, bought it anyway for $9.99 (because it's awesome)
4. Coupon wasn't used
5. Epic support won't refund the coupon amount

You'd assume that Shadow Tactics would be free but the coupon wouldn't renew. That's the basic function of a coupon: use it like money at a specific vendor. Epic's conditions of renewal should be on top of that, otherwise it's not a coupon.

Nope. Not according to Epic support:

&gt; I know how important it is to clarify things out as to why your coupon was not applied on your purchase for Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. Allow me to share with you the result of my evaluation.

&gt; Upon checking here on our end, I was able to see that the reason why the coupon was not applied on your last purchase is due to the amount of the game doesn't is under $14.99. I'd like to kindly inform you that in order for you to be able to use the coupon, the amother of the game should be $14.99 or more.

&gt; I hope that I was able to clarify things out. On top of this, thank you for your continuous support on us.

Broken English and spelling errors aside, that guy is wrong. Their coupon terms clearly state:

&gt; If you use that $10 Epic Coupon towards purchasing an eligible title, you’ll receive an additional $10 Epic Coupon. During the entire event, you’ll continue receiving an Epic Coupon for each eligible game purchase! Eligible game purchases are $14.99 or more and exclude pre-purchases, in-game purchases, DLC, and season passes.

Nothing in there talks about the fundamental mechanics of a coupon. What this says to me is that we all got a coupon and as long as you buy games over $15 you keep getting the coupon back. The moment you use the coupon on a game under $15 the coupon is spent and done. Kind of like a game mechanic, makes sense for a game company. Sort of confusing. Whatever. But according to Epic, that's not what it is.

If the purpose of the coupon was to be a site-wide discount of $10 on any full game over $14.99 until July 2020, why not just say that? Why have a renewing coupon that expires but cannot be used for purchases of less than a certain amount? That's not a coupon, that's a discount with extra steps and sneaky conditions. This is misleading.

I love Epic and the EGS is mostly fine, but please for the love of fuck stop giving everyone excuses to drop shit on you.",Those bloody coupons,,1577687438.0,2019-12-31 07:30:38

A few days ago i bought Batman Shadows Edition on Epic. The first season worked just fine, but i have a lot of problems with the second one. At the beginning i couldn't select any episodes after clicking ""Play shadows edition"". I wrote to the support for the help or the potential refund. They said they won't give me my money back because of the playtime (I finished season I) and they suggested to reinstall gpu drivers and directx which obviously didn't work. After a while i finally dealt with the problem, it was propably a problem with a cloud save. So i finished first episode, but i can't play the rest of them. When I select any other episode it says it's ""Purchased, not installed"" and when i try to install it, it says ""New content is downloaded and is ready to be installed. Install it by restarting the main menu?"", when i click yes it returns me back to the main menu but nothing actually happens, i'm asked to do this over and over. I tried everything, reinstalling the game and such. I'm frustrated to the point i'm considering just giving up with Epic.

1577528540,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/egp9lf/trying_to_find_a_way_to_play_egspurchased_red/,"Not sure if this has been posted before, but I'm trying to find a way to play my EGS-purchased copy of Red Dead through Steam Remote Play. Yes, I know it's now also for sale on Steam itself - you don't have to rub it in.

**The problem**  
EGS-game shortcuts launch through a URL that looks like this *com.epicgames.launcher://apps/Heather?action=launch&amp;silent=true*. I assume this tells the store-process to launch the ""Heather""-app (which is Epic's weird naming scheme for local games). Steam can't add this URL-shortcut as a non-Steam game tho, because it's not an executable. I guess Remote Play hooks into a running process and streams the displayed application as video. This only works with some executables tho. And - appearantly - not CEF/Electron-apps like the EGS-client, or I would be able to stream the client itself and start RDR2 from there. But that also doesn't work. 

Then there's both *RDR2.exe* and *PlayRDR2.exe* in the game's install-folder. But those just seem to be different ways into the Rockstar Games Launcher. One starts with ""**Red Dead Redemption 2 was unable to authenticate with Epic Online Services**"", the other starts a non logged-in version of the store. Both fail to start the game through Remote Play because Rockstar seems to want you to use the EGS-store for some kind of DRM-verification. And it will only connect with EGS if it was launched from there (?).

So now I'm stuck trying to find a way to juggle these 3 store-clients. I'm thinking it might work if I can launch the EGS-shortcut from the command line with some arguments, which will in turn launch the Rockstar Games Launcher and the RDR2 process. Then I can add that to Steam and maybe stream that? But there doesn't seem to be a way to launch *EpicGamesLauncher.exe* with any such arguments.

TL;DR: I'm living the storefront-launcher nightmare.",Trying to find a way to play EGS-purchased Red Dead Redemption 2 through Steam Remote Play,,1577485340.0,2019-12-28 23:22:20

&gt;So, guess what I found out today? Games that use the Unreal Engine will disable Sticky keys if they are enabled, when you start up the game, and then re-enable them when you exit out of the game.
&gt;
&gt;I tested this with:
&gt;
Spyro
&gt;
Spacebourne
&gt;
&gt;Bard's Tale IV Director's Cut
&gt;
Those are the 3 games I currently have installed that use Unreal Engine.
&gt;
From what I have read, Epic Client runs on the Unreal Engine, so it looks like it has a bug of re-enabling the sticky keys, regardless if you had sticky keys enabled or not.
&gt;
&gt;I believe it is a safe assumption that there is a good reason for why Unreal Engine will disable Sticky keys if they are enabled, and it is normal behavior to disable the sticky keys and then re-enable them when exiting out of the game. And that what is being seen now with the Epic client is a bug in this operation.

I also own Bards Tale IV, and saw it disable sticky keys and then re enable them when exiting out of the game. 

I also own Mechwarrior 5, Operencia, and KINE, all UE4 games and can be played without Epic client running, and I observed the same thing as he did with the games he mentioned. 

So I am in agreement with his conclusion.  UE4 games/software are suppose to disable sticky keys, and turn them back on when exiting.  So there is a bug with the client that is turning it back on even if it was disabled before starting the client.",Found a post that brings new info about sticky key issue,,1577435128.0,2019-12-28 09:25:28

I'm pretty sure there were already a lot of people talking about this, and to be honest I'm not a crazy achievement hunter myself. But I do love achievements because i love the idea that the game 'validates and rewards' me for completing challenges.  Game achievement was one of the reasons why i stop pirating games and willing to spend hundreds of hours to replaying some games that i really love. And since every PC game store have this feature, so there is no reason why EGS doesn't have this. This is the only feature that i really look forward to be introduced to EGS.

Well I fiddled around and noticed the Direct11-12 switch. I changed it and reset, and everything was great. Even the fan stopped turning so hard.

But when I finished playing.. my screen resolution was all janked up. The colors are all off, the tops and sides go off screen and it's just unpleasant. No matter what I try in settings, everything just stays so wrong.

So whilst I don’t need a fix for this game in particular, there’s a bunch of games on Epic that seem like they should work according to listed specs but it won’t even attempt to install because it thinks the OS is unsupported.

Is this a glitch or oversight because so few people are 32 bit any more? Or are they different versions for some bizarre reason?

What I've found fixes it is to turn all video options to the lowest but this is ruining the experience and I do not want to play the game on low quality.

When the game crashes it becomes unresponsive, I can still hear the audio playing the screen simply freezes, if I alt+tab I see a static shot of the main menu. Eventually a windows prompt will inform me that the application has become unresponsive.

So what I've tried:  
Relog my Epic Client  
Relog my UPlay Client  
Checked if the transaction went through  
Checked if the accounts are linked (they are not, but the base game worked, so why wouldn't the season pass)

Next step was Epic's customer support which gave me the following answer:

""I understand you have issues with the Anno 1800 Season Pass.

Let me inform you We do not support it anymore. However if you have issues with the game, you can contact the developer: https://support.ubi.com""

&amp;#x200B;

Little bit of back story, I had founded a company with 4 friends in 2014, and expected the company to thrive for years. After 4 years and a hostile takeover by our newest primary investor I was laid off mid May 2018.  As any company does when they let someone go, they turn off your company email account. Now to this point, I had made no purchases on the account. Near the end of 2018, I realized my Epic Games account was still hooked to my old company email.  The Epic Games Launcher was fairly new, and had very little in the way of expected functions.  I emailed customer support, corresponded over a few emails, and was told that currently their system wouldn't allow for the email change, but to give it time and check back as updates were coming to site and launcher.

&amp;#x200B;

Early 2019 I purchase Satisfactory through the Epic Games Launcher as it is a game style I enjoy. Invoice was sent to of course the email on account, which I don't have access to.  A week ago I went to my Epic account to change my email, cannot as it sends a request to the old email first, so I contact support. I have answered their ridiculous questions to best of my ability, and even provided a picture of my state issued drivers license.  Since I apparently cannot provide an Invoice ID, as I didn't screenshot the sale and the email of the invoice went to an email I have no access to, that trumps what they admitted is a valid drivers license.

1576391198,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/eavkm9/detroit_become_human_possible_soultion_for/,"With my game, i was struggling with terrible performance. When i moved it to SSD game was crashing in menu or even before or not starting at all. But i found a possible solution for both problems! Try this i hope it will help.

When i struggled with making space on my ssd to fit this game, I deleted my virtual memory settings. That's why it was crashing all the time. The thing is some apps like this game NEED a virtual memory, it may be more important with low RAM like mine(only 8gb). You just need to add it or expand even more. Now game is running, and performance is PERFECT comparing to before (not sure its this or my SSD). I have all maxed out and 60fps, running completely fine, some minor drops maybe but not that annoying stutters from before.

&amp;#x200B;

DETAILED HOW TO:

&amp;#x200B;

Right click on ""This PC"" and select Properties. Then Advanced Settings, Advanced tab and settings under performance tab. Then advanced tab once more and the change button at the bottom. Deselect the Automatically manage paging file size for all drives check box, check Custom Size and type ur new settings and then click Set and OK. You can set ur ram value in initial size and 3xRAM in maximum size like i did myself, for example: 8gb ram then initial size 8gb and maximum size 24gb.

&amp;#x200B;

If u had crash problem, its saved now. Performance problem? Not sure, mine improved but idk thats the reason, feel free to answer if it helped \^\^

I wanted to move a game off my SSD to my HDD. I have to say, the Epic games launcher is a complete and utter mess here, as it gives no option to do so. I tried to work around it, but it's simply not working. Can anyone help, please?

What I did:

a) Copy game to a new folder on the intended drive, but with a temporary folder name change, i.e. 'BeyondTwoSouls\_TEMP'

b) Uninstall game from the first drive.

c) Reinstall game on the intended drive as \\BeyondTwoSouls.

d) Quit the Epicgameslauncher ones it starts downloading.

e) Delete the \\BeyondTwoSouls folder from the intended drive.

f) Rename the temporary folder on the intended drive from step a) to '\\BeyondTwoSouls'

e) Look in horror as the appdata web cache keeps corrupting itself. Once I retried everything again, and the launcher managed not to corrupt itself entirely, it still did not recognize the game files now in \\BeyondTwoSouls. In fact, it forgets I even tried to install it.

All in all, what kind of magic do I need to perform to move an install folder? Does it involve sacrificing goats and first born sons? I don't want to redownload what I already have. I have the bloody game files, now I just need the launcher to fix the registry and enable cloud save support (although I could do without the latter).

I tried to look up for this issue online but either I am the only one or I don't know how to describe it well enough to get a hit in Google. The funny thing is that the launcher works, if I get to library I can see my games there and in the screen it is in the picture I can scroll. I I try to maximize it, it'll duplicate the top bar where the X is to full screen, but nothing will work.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried of course to reboot the system and reinstalling the launcher. I don't know if a VPN might cause this type of issues but I tried disconnecting it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone has a solution or idea of why this happens? Oh, another thing, it was working right about a week ago, it just started now

They asked if I wanted help resolving why the game wouldn't run. Told them I already did this with the other support team, and all I wanted was a refund. I was then told that I didn't wualify for a refund.

I told help I bought the gane 10 days ago, still 4 days before the 14 day linit. And explaine there was no way I could have played 2 hours because the game freezes as soon as it starts. Maybe it's reading that frozen screen as playtime?

I was using a VPN on my computer, I was using for some non-epic-launcher-related purpose, I wasn't even playing nothing on it neither had a single game installed and wasn't using it for days. The launcher was only logged in on my Windows's tray, but after that day I noticed that my login access is somehow limited and blocked when I am connected through my default ISP, even with different IP addresses.

I tried a different ISP (same region) but in different place, and the launcher logged as normal without any issue, but for the ISP I have in home it doesn't work anymore.

The Launcher itself accept my network requests but when I input my credentials and click on login button it keeps loading forever on the redirect dialog and stuck on this loading screen forever, on the website I can login with success but every page loads with a message telling ""Uh oh, something went wrong. Please try again"", except the Account settings, so I can change my password and enable 2FA for example, but just that.

After recent update of Epic Launcher i encountered a problem that launcher showed white blank space with text menu on the left side of the window.

It all looked like a web page in text format, but whatever i wanted to click did not work... I tried restarting the Program than PC than checking Internet connection... nothing worked and internet was fine...

Now comes the REAL PROBLEM...

I finally decided to reinstall the launcher... Knowing that it is your own product the person reading this is probably snickering already knowing what happened...

First i uninstalled the faulty launcher...

Downloaded and installed the latest one from main page...

And guess what... Now i looked into the folder where ALL of my games were installed and my whole FFFing game library is GONE...

Uninstalling the launcher deleted the whole game library...

I don't know who the F is coding in your company but i think this is the first game launcher that works like that... Other ones like Steam Origin Uplay Battlenet don't even ask in the uninstalling process ""Do you want delete your game library YES/NO"" because people go automatically in the uninstalling process ""Enter, enter, yes yes done uninstalled""

Who even read what pops up... 

I don't know whose fault it is yours or mine but now i need to re-download hundreds of gigabytes of data...

How many times, how many years should the community ask Epic for a not-so-bad launcher? Every month, every week, every update we get more bugs over unresolved bugs and worse and worse performance... Love the engine, good games, fair developers revenue, but holy cow Epic, your extremely low performant and laggy launcher feels like a joke. 

Who coded this launcher? a single student on a weekend? It is just a fake webpage! +120mb of ram to render images, text and basic 2d effects! You created and entire C++ multiplatform game engine, but cannot code a small launcher?? really?? i'm getting 120 fps on 3d games on fullscreen filled with a lot of FX and dynamic lighting, but cannot browse ""my projects"" library without scroll lag!!

And not a single ""guys, we heard you"" or  ""we are going to separate the game store from developers part"" or ""we are going to rewrite the launcher"" or ""we are going to open an API so you can create a launcher"" or even a ""we are aware of the launcher problems"", no, nothing at all...

and i can really see why.

tetris effect is a really really good game!

but superly overpriced.

its one of those games that would make more if would cost less.

no one is gonna buy ""a tetris game"" for 40$.

and i mean, look how people in the world look at tetris, 

a classic game that doesnt look for them....

if it had a free weakened or would cost like 15$ or 20$ to be fair, it would make a lot more.

you can easly see how after the playstation limited time demo it had tons of new players.

they also showed the game as something amazing.....

epic just doesnt. and im really disapointed from this because its an amzing game that everyone should play...

but i do think its just not worth buying now, and probably a lot more.

I realize to download RDR2 at 100+ GB this is going to take *days*.  No problem.

This can't possibly be correct?!  I will never be able to download it ... unless presumably I do not lose my internet connection for DAYS and force my PC not to ever go to sleep?

Also, it uses 100% bandwidth and it can't be throttled.  Using the internet for anything else while downloading is impossible, so I had to install NetLimiter 4 just to cap the process.

# New Launched Features:

* New Storefront
* Checkout Overlay
* Storefront Optimization: 

&gt;\- By implementing local caching, we reduced queries to remote data stores and almost eliminated time spent accessing remote databases.   
&gt;  
&gt;\- Hot local caches also mean that an increase in traffic results in better performance. For example, during a 350% traffic increase leading up to the Fortnite Chapter 2 event, our service response time decreased by 30%.

* 3D Secure for Europe
* Thai Language Support

# Development In Progress

* Wishlist

1572026183,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/dn14kp/the_epic_games_launcherstore_the_nvidia_shield_tv/,"I recently bought Borderlands 3 so I could play it on the Shield TV, which has replaced both the PS4 and the Apple TV at our house due to the availability of games &amp; a wider array of entertainment media. BL3 streams *gorgeously* from Epic's own servers, and while the login procedure is a pain (it asks to relogin to their game store each time, and the login process happens in a new window that doesn't recognize the Shield remote or controller, so you have to get our your phone and the Shield app – or a bluetooth keyboard – for that part), it's a great game.

However, I noticed that once in awhile during the login procedure it will fail and drop out into the Epic Game Store. And my list of games – mostly the free games that I get from their weekly giveaways – are all listed as being in my library, yay. I wondered what would happen if I tried to launch them?

Turns out most work BEAUTIFULLY. You have to install (which means installing it into your particular temporary instance on their server, and not directly onto the Shield, I believe), but at that point the games work GREAT and some of them have really well-thought-out controller support too, mapped perfectly for the Shield controller.

For example, last night I ran The Observer, a sort of cyberpunk/horror FPS, and it looked AMAZING and played perfectly. Everything worked just right. Metro 2033 Redux also streams perfectly.

Anyone else got other ""unlisted"" Epic games to run well on this device?

The only problems are:

* because Epic and Nvidia aren't really in communication and don't plan these things out too well, no icon for the games shows up on your desktop. You still have to maneuver into the Epic launcher to make it work;
* with the exception of Borderlands 3 and other games that have ""official"" Epic support on the Shield TV, you will have to reinstall each time, but it does seem to keep save data, as far as I can tell so far; and
* since this is not official, I imagine support could drop at any time.

I really wish that Nvidia gave a bit more support to the games section of the OS; there are a lot of games that SHOULD work well, if Epic is willing to host them – for example, I'd love to play The Cycle and The Outer Worlds and the upcoming Cyberpunk game – but unless they are listed in the official NVidia game store, this seems really complicated.

But in case Epic is listening ... I would totally buy these games. Steam, you too – make it easier to play games on this device (don't make me go through the whole rigamarole of logging in, using your separate app, etc) and I'll buy more games from you.

Even just the ability to directly launch the Epic Games Launcher would be a HUGE boon. It's obviously on the machine – just make it directly available to us!

Steam allows me to configure a specific steam controller setup per-game which is borderline essential for its use.

Generally I've been able to add the game exe to steam and launch from there in order to get the steam controller working at least (hey, this is bad for engagement, think about the engagement). This stopped working for Control (the non-google-friendly-named game by Remedy) earlier tonight, which now gives ""Content Error, Unable to log in"" whenever I launch it from anywhere but the Epic Launcher.

Anybody got any good workarounds on any of this stuff?

Also, if somebody comes along here and tells me that they're having a different experience, that Radeon Settings detects their game fine, that's useful information.

**Can anyone help me recover my Epic Games account or provide me with information or advice as to how I can do this please?**

Hi

I am having major trouble verifying my Epic Games Account and wondered if anyone could help me at all please?

My account has been banned on Fortnite and I have no idea why. Epic Games will not remove the ban from my account, or tell me why the account has been banned, as they say I am unable to verify my account. 

After I became aware that there was a ban on the account I emailed Epic Games. They then asked me to provide my public IP address, account creation date, invoice ID, locations where purchases made, original display name, last 4 digits of payment, date of last login, names of other accounts connected to my Epic account. 

After various emails backwards and forwards with Epic Games, with me trying to provide them with the information they have requested, they still said the information I had provided did not verify my account. They would not tell me which parts of the information I have submitted is correct and which parts are not. 

I'm not the most tech savvy person in the world, especially when it comes to gaming and to be honest, I only got into it less than one year ago because of my son, who is the main person that plays the game. So, I asked some friends with good IT / gaming knowledge and none of them have any idea how to help as some of the information requested is impossible for me to give them:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your public IP address(es)      (IPv4) - my internet provider does not provide a static IP address but a      dynamic one, therefore everytime the Xbox is disconnected from the wired      in internet, it changes. The internet is not the best in the rurual area I      live so we often disconnect the Xbox from the internet cable, for example      if we are trying to watch a streamed show on Netflix. You can only do one      thing at once with our internet. I gave Epic Games an IP address each time      I responded to them, which would have been right at the time I sent it. I      also gave them screen shots from the search I carried out on my Xbox to      show I was searching from that device and the IP address that was revealed      at the time. 
2. I also didn't have the exact      creation date of my account, as I first set up the account after      downloading the app to my Ipad but knew it was in 2018 at some point.      However, I was able to give a more accurate date of when the account was      used to start playing regularly on the Xbox. This was Christmas December      2018. I'd never received any emails from Epic Games at the time I set up      the account on the Ipad, so could not search for an email confirming the      date it was set up. I can only assume that if I did get an email like      this, my IT provider at the time filtered it out as spam and I am unable      to find it via any searches. My IT provider is through work and has now      changed so I would not be able to ask them this. 
3. I did not have, or ever have      had an Invoice ID from Epic Games, as all my purchases are made through      Microsoft. I provided them with a few examples of copies of invoices from      Microsoft, including the last one to date. I logged into my Epic Games      Account and provided a screen shot of my payment history, which clearly      stated none, as I have only ever purchased through Microsoft.
4. I gave them the correct      location of where these purchases were made, my actual home address in      fact, which I dont think you could get any more precise?
5. I provided the correct      display name for when I played the game. I also provided them with screen      shots of me logged into the Epic Games Store showing my account details,      email address, display name etc. 
6. I gave them the information      of the credit card that was used for my purchases via Microsoft and      pointed out that the location of the purchases were made at the same      address as the billing address on the card. I also pointed out that the      last email invoice I'd received from Microsoft for purchases I had made in      Fortnite gave an order number and the last 4 digits of the credit card      used, which matched the last 4 digits I had stated to satisfy this      requirement.
7. I could not give the exact      last date of my login, but the date I gave might be wrong by only one day.
8. We only use the Xbox now but      previously we used my Ipad.

I have now completely hit a brick wall with Epic Games after 3 or 4 times of trying to satisfy their requirements with my information. Therefore, I decided to Google my issue to see if anyone else has had similar problems to me and came across a post on Reddit where the person was experiencing almost exactly the same issues.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/a7nere/epic\_games\_refuses\_to\_give\_me\_my\_account\_back/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/a7nere/epic_games_refuses_to_give_me_my_account_back/)

After reading this post and realising that I am not the only person this has happened to, in a last ditch attempt to try and recover my account, I thought I would reach out to the Reddit community and ask; **would anyone be kind enough to help me recover my account or provide me with information or advice as to how I can please?** I would be extremely grateful as we have achievements and have spent money on V-Bucks, skins etc and I'm reluctant to loose it all.

Many thanks",Epic Games Account Verification Issues - PLEASE HELP!!!!!,,1571278679.0,2019-10-18 03:17:59
1571305969,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/dj44g9/paid_40_dollars_for_nothing_last_purchase_ill/,"I just wanted to write to someone of the horrible customer service I experienced when trying to purchase the year 1 pass for the Division 2 from the Epic store.

I bought the core game of the Division on September 26, 2019. I played for a while and before the Episode 1 content launched I decided to buy the Year 1 pass. I attempted to buy the pass on October 12, 2019. I went through the Epic store to make this purchase as I'm playing on PC, just like I had done to buy the core game, and money was withdrawn from my account. When I attempted to login to the division 2 for the first time after purchasing, I discovered that I did not have access to any of the content included in the year 1 pass.

I exited the game and found an error message displayed in the epic launcher, the error message was PI-UBI-02. The rest of the message told me to restart my PC and make sure I wasn't connected through a VPN, which I did, and I'm not.

After still not having access to the content, I contacted Epic for support. They do not offer any method of contacting them aside from email. So I opened a ticket through email on Oct 12th. They asked several very unhelpful questions, such as, ""did you purchase either the game or the DLC content from Uplay prior purchasing from Epic Games store?"". I was shocked at this question since I'm fairly sure nobody enjoys paying for something twice. After confirming with them that I did in fact only purchase it once and through their store. They referred me to Ubisoft. I was able to use their chat support and worked with their rep but was unable to resolve the content not showing up.

I then reached back out to Epic and asked for a refund of the Year 1 Season pass. Since this has all taken place through email support and I have gone a full day between two different interactions, I'm now here. Epic is refusing to give me a refund of the Year 1 Season pass, claiming I've played 26 hours of the game. Which I tried to correct them that it was 26 hours of game time with the core game, and 0 hours of game time with any content for the year 1 season pass. I still don't have access to this content that I have paid 40 dollars for and am incredibly frustrated with the entire situation and with the game at this point. I want to play this game, and I want to have fun while I do it, but this experience has and is leaving a sour taste in my mouth and I'm not sure what else to do at this point.

I don't know if this rant will accomplish anything, or if anyone will actually read it, but I am hopeful that someone will find it and something can be done in the future so that other people don't have to have a similar experience to me.","Paid 40 dollars for nothing, last purchase I'll ever make through Epic",,1571262769.0,2019-10-17 22:52:49

Why is Epic's support team allowed not to reply to people? There is no profanity or complaining. It is simple, factual information like my email and the issues in place.  


The short version right now, is they refuse to send me a copy of my receipt from borderlands 3. After being stiffed my 60 refund for paragon points spent for not being able to ""produce my receipt"" I am being pro-active about this. Well the game's been out for a while and it's been months since my pre-order and guess what? I still have no receipt.  


This isn't about spam folders in my email or trash, or some automatic filter. It just isn't there. Wouldn't you guess it, I've been unable to play BL3 due to a gamebreaking bug and now I'm not able to access my refund with Epic (As Gearbox forwarded me there.) Due to an inability to produce my receipt.  


This feels like criminal theft in the tune of 160 dollars so far from Epic games. Does anyone have any ideas what to do so far with a situation like this? I don't want to write off Epic completely, but I would really like either A- My games work and not be shut down or B- be refunded when they are unplayable. This is rough.

Yesterday a Hearthstone champion was livestreamed saying ""liberate Hong Kong!""  As a result, Blizzard has banned the player from competing, taken his prize money, deleted the VOD of the stream and suspended the two hosts who let him say it.

As a result of *that,* a lot of people are pretty upset, asking for refunds on Blizzard games, their main subreddit is set to private, and everywhere else Blizzard discussion exists is in a bit of an uproar.

[https://kotaku.com/blizzard-subreddit-closes-after-devs-suspend-hearthston-1838880136](https://kotaku.com/blizzard-subreddit-closes-after-devs-suspend-hearthston-1838880136)

As that was all happening, on the broader world stage the general manager of the Houston Rockets Daryl Morey tweeted out support for Hong Kong, and China retaliated by suspending business dealings with the Rockets.  At first the NBA seemed to distance themselves from Morey, but they've since walked it back a bit after backlash.

[https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768225490/nba-defends-freedom-of-speech-for-employees-as-china-moves-to-block-block-games](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768225490/nba-defends-freedom-of-speech-for-employees-as-china-moves-to-block-block-games)

&gt;as NPR's Scott Neuman reported, ""Tencent, a media partner of the NBA in China with a five-year streaming deal worth $1.5 billion, and China's state television also said they wouldn't be airing Rockets games.""

This all made me curious what would happen if messages in support of Hong Kong started appearing on Epic's platform, which is 40% owned by Tencent.

Anyone in contact with any developers out there who could help with this?  It costs next to nothing and it's for a good cause.  Just a brief callout in the credits, or a splash screen if you're more daring.  Even tweeting messages of support might make a difference.

I know there are people that don't like Epic store and others that do.... I am not here to take any sides.

I have been getting the free games that have been on offer, why not!

However I didn't jump on the band wagon initially...

Do you think Epic may one day offer people who missed out on past titles to come back and pick up something they missed?

I think Epic's goal is to get people to amass a nice little collection on here so that people eventually buy another title and try to shift behaviours in buying from predominately one store all the time.... so if this is their objective why not allow people who missed out on past deals to get another opportunity to pick something up!?

I have some inconvenience with closing the app from the Windows system tray. The context menu has 2 buttons with a fairly similar meaning in Russian locale.
Problem: I often log out of my account by mistake. Annoying 
Solution: 
1)Require user confirmation for Log off
2)Move the Log off button to another place. 
This button there is unnecessary. It seems to me that the user rarely Log out from his account.

Whenever I am connected to the internet and try to start the launcher, a black screen comes up, I get a blue loading bar, the ""Verifying"" prompt, then nothing.  It sits there for maybe 2 minutes then dies.  If I DO happen to get the launcher open while online, Borderlands 3 will crash along with the Launcher before I have enough time to get into a game.  If I disconnect my internet completely, the launcher comes up with no issue and I can play BL3 offline.  I have also tried starting the launcher offline to get it running, connecting to the internet, then launching the game and I get the same result:  crash.  I have no entries in any Event Viewer window I can think to check nor do I get an error message from BL3 or Epic.  Never had any issue running any other game on this machine.  


Additional info  
\- Attempted to play at multiple locations so the internet connection was different.  
\- This happens on both wired and wireless  
\- Have tried reinstalling both the launcher and the game on multiple drives with similar results

The first time around, the icon would blink repeatedly in the task bar, and in the task manager, EGS alternates between being an active application and a background process. All this would happen after giving the installer permissions to make changes to their device, and permissions for the prerequisites to be installed.

We've tried a clean install, but that still wouldn't work. We've tried running the installer with no other background applications running, but that still doesn't work.

Then we followed a guide which suggested we put '-openGL' to the end of the target destination under properties when you right click the shortcut. That solved the blinking issue, but the launcher still wouldn't open, and mousing over it shows a grey screen as a preview. Clicking on the task bar would start up the blinking issue again. Now, however, the screen asking for permissions for the prerequisites to be installed doesn't show up anymore.

This is really perplexing for me, and frustrating for my friend, so I'm hoping to see if anyone else has had the same issue and if anyone knows how to go about fixing this.",Friend having issue with installing EGS,,1569976946.0,2019-10-03 01:42:26

1569954793,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/dbxk50/charged_2_times_any_ideas/,"Hello everyone! 

I created an Epic Store account via the website as I was purchasing Borderlands 3. It said the purchase went through, but when I finished, I was unable to login to the Epic store account on my Epic Games launcher. I never received an account verification email from Epic or an emailed receipt of regarding my purchase. I even tried to reset the password in case I mixed up a letter or something during account creation, but never received any password reset emails. 

After about 2 hours of waiting, I made a new Epic games account and was able to use the same email. I linked it to my Google account thinking maybe that would help with login issues. I logged in, purchased game, received email, etc, and was able to download and play. 

I realized though that even though Epic hadn’t sent me anything, PayPal had sent me a receipt. I logged into my PayPal and saw that I had indeed been charged twice for BL3. 

So I figured I would just put in a refund request and that would be the end of it. I have refunded games before with Steam and Origin and figured this would be a painless process. I put in a refund request and explained I had been charged twice, but unfortunately, the responses I have received have not been helpful. One of the responses was that I had played the game for 2 hours so I could not receive a refund. I explained again that I had been charged two times and wanted to continue playing, I just needed one of the charges refunded. I then got several emails from them attempting to help me reset the password of the account that I am currently using to play Borderlands 3. We have been emailing back and forth for about 3 days and they still don’t acknowledge that I just want to return that extra charge.

Typically I think this is a situation where you would just contact the credit card company and do a chargeback, with a heads up that you had just been charged twice so it can be taken care of, but I have heard that Epic bans accounts if they do a chargeback and I am worried that I wouldn’t be able to play Borderlands 3 on my working account.

Does anyone have any ideas or know how I can possibly get this escalated to someone who understands my request? I want to continue playing Borderlands - I just don’t want to pay $120 for my one copy.",Charged 2 Times - Any Ideas?,,1569911593.0,2019-10-02 07:33:13

But during this time, my computer hard crashed at least 50 or more times, twice saved file got corrupted and right now I have no idea wtf is wrong with the game that when I start the game, it gets stuck after the initial three brand logos and I see claptrap running left to right. 
I have reinstalled game numerous times, reinstalled ES app, verified game numerous time and still no results. If I let it sit like that the game eventually starts after about 10 minutes. 
I would still deal with this shit if there were no abrupt game and computer crashes. I have 24gb ram, i5 and vega64, and my computer can easily run this game at high or ultra without flinching and crashes still continue to happen even if I play at very low settings. 

And I give up. I absolutely love the game but can’t deal with this nonsense. Good for the folks who are able to play it without any issue but I have reached my limit and I promise I won’t buy any game from epic store again. What a joke. 

I already bought the game again on PS4 but experience is not even close as not only my PC can support better gameplay but also mouse and key board are better for a shooter game like BL3. 

After spending more than 120 bucks, I am going to pirate the game when it gets cracked if that version runs smoothly on PC.

Mind you, I only installed it on EPIC because a friend of mine told me about his experience and asked me to see if I could play the game. I bought Squad on Steam a long time ago and have absolutely no problem playing it on Steam.

1569021068,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d72ou8/cant_log_into_my_egs_account_six_days_in_and/,"So a week ago I was on the day one hype train for Borderlands 3, as were a lot of others, including a couple friends of mine, who I had planned on playing with - and on that first day? Things were excellent - it's an awesome game and we really enjoyed ourselves. Went to bed feeling completely justified for a hundred dollar pre-order. 

The next morning, though, I couldn't log into my EGS account. It wasn't as though I was putting in the wrong password - my computer autofills it for me, and even in browser it wouldn't work. Not even the code I had written near my desk worked, even though that was absolutely the password I've been using all this time. I couldn't even get in to play the game I had waited months to play.

So I contact support; initially, it's reasonable, with a single day wait for someone to get back to me - though, she referred me to 2K even though it was an issue with the launcher, something I corrected her on in a follow-up email, which she hasn't responded to since. Nothing, for five days. So I opened another ticket, only to be INSTANTLY, within 30 minutes, shot down and asked to wait for my initial email to be responded to. As if that wasn't bad enough, today I got an email asking me if I was satisfied with my service from not only the ticket I just opened, but the ticket that I had submitted in the first place as well. I can't get into my account, and password recovery won't even go into my email - do I sound very satisfied?

I just wanna play this game. I'm a patient person, but after a week's gone by and everyone around me is already finished with their first playthrough while I'm stuck here sitting and waiting for someone to get back to me about an account I NEVER touched until Borderlands 3's release suddenly going dark, I feel it's reasonable to panic just a little bit. 

Does getting this ""are you satisfied"" email mean that my ticket's been closed? I got two, one for each of them, so I assume so - but they never ended up helping me, so it wouldn't make any sense. Do I just have to keep waiting, or am I stuck in customer support limbo?

I have a pretty serious social anxiety disorder, so calling by the phone isn't really an option for me, but I'm seriously at my wits end here.

Recently, I accidentally logged in with another email that apparently was linked with another one of my epic games accounts, let’s say account B, and proceeded to buy and start playing borderlands 3 on a bunch. I only realized when I launched Fortnite recently that I was on a different account because I didn’t have any Of my stuff except for the borderlands pack (which I now wish was on the account A). At first I decided I guess I could just log in and out each time I want to play a different game now, but that would be inefficient and I wouldn’t get my borderlands pack in my account A Fortnite profile. 
So, my first question: is there anyway to merge my 2 epic games accounts, or atleast transfer all my stuff/progress for games from account B to A?
Now my second question: How the hell do I log out of the epic games launcher?! If I can’t find a way to merge or transfer my data with accounts A and B, then my next option would be the sign in and out when switching games option that I mentioned earlier, but I don’t know how to sign out! Can’t find it in my settings or anything!

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in the middle of playing on Friday night, my game suddenly started freaking out and it locked up my whole computer. After restarting my computer, I was given the cloud option thing and I chose local because the cloud had only saved like 90 minutes in or something. I started getting that error that everyone else was getting but noticed my time played was being racked up REALLY quick: by the end of Sunday night it said I had over 50 hours played?! I hadn't even gotten beyond level 12...

&amp;#x200B;

After looking for a solution and asking more technologically capable what to do, they told me it was a DRM issue. I put in a ticket for help which I still haven't heard anything from about.  


Finally I had enough waiting to play a game that I had just paid for and put in for a refund. I woke up this morning to an email saying that my refund wouldn't be processed because the launcher said I had more than 2 hours played in the game. Rolling my eyes because either this was an automated message or the person didn't actually read my email, I went to twitter to try and see if I could find help from a live person from Epic. I saw they said they had released a hotfix for problems with the cloud.   


I try to log in... and it works! First thing I notice was the main character on the screen is a level 20 Fl4k. I had tried out Fl4k but wasn't a fan and left him at level 6. I go to switch to my level 12something Zane... and the character has been deleted. In its place are 2 more Fl4ks and a level 1 Moze that I knew wasn't from me because I had no interest in the character.   


First thought: I WAS HACKED. I changed my password, did the two-part authentication that I didn't even know Epic had until I went to find out what to do about being hacked in their help section.   


Second thought, a couple minutes later after calming down (a little because I'm still annoyed I need to make a new character and start the story from the beginning): Did they switch my cloud data with someone else's when they were fixing things? Why is that almost as terrifying as the idea of being hacked?",Either my cloud save data was replaced with someone else's... or I was HACKED.,,1568698798.0,2019-09-18 05:39:58

I would say I am hour into the game and have just reached the first boss in the game, you might say things are up in the air. 

* The **gameplay and controls** are extremely fluid and intuitive.  I was terrified watching trailers that controlling the abilities would be a confusing combination of buttons, but its so far is a button press and then aim mouse and let go of button.  Feels super natural and over powered, like well a super hero.  
* The **graphics and performance** of the game are fairly excellent, I did see some minor stuttering in certain combat scenes but overall its extremely smooth for me, granted I am playing on a RX 5700 and i7 9700k at 1080p 75hz.  The visuals themselves have a very realistic feeling to them and honestly I am jealous of anyone playing this game with ray tracing because that only makes it even better.  Still without ray tracing the game looks phenomenal at Ultra Setting.
* The **story and exploration** is extremely unique and well other worldly in the existence of Altered World Events and Paranormal Objects and so on so forth.  Lets just say you quickly want to learn of what has happened at The Bureau and the story behind the main character.  My one concern is there is so much exploring to do and places you dont have access to right away I am nervous I will simply miss so much stuff.  I was wondering does anything ever get locked or missed if you progress to far into the main missions? How have you gone about exploring the Bureau? 

**Overall** I really am enjoying this game, and think its worth $60 as the gameplay/combat is fun and unique, the story is gripping and mysterious, and the game just looks like art.",Control: First Impressions,,1568610219.0,2019-09-17 05:03:39
1568651255,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d532fk/one_solution_to_error_88500000_message/,"For those encountering the error 88500000 message (where it posts a codefusion web link) when trying to run the Borderlands3.exe file (especially if this is the message you get when trying to right-click and Run the .exe from the program folder), I've found a solution that helped me resolve this. Been able to play the beginning part of game with zero issues so far since solving it this morning!

First of all, I use a NVIDIA GTX 1070 (laptop version) and use a 1080p monitor (Zowie), and based on my solution it looks like the error 88500000 was something possibly NVIDIA GPU related?

So I first right-clicked on Desktop, went to NVIDIA Control Panel &gt; Display &gt; Change Resolution &gt; Under ""PC"" heading, I selected ""1280 x 720"".

Then I booted up EGS Launcher &gt; Library &gt; BL3 Launch

Splash screen FINALLY loads, and game starts running (2K Gearbox intro, opening intro, etc.). Then I reach the Main Menu. Now, the 2K support recently said other users who did manage to get to Options Menu (they didn't help me figure out the whole NVIDIA Control Panel thing. That I had to figure out on my own via trial &amp; error hahah), should go to Visuals &gt; Set Display &gt; FULLSCREEN mode (default is Windowed Fullscreen, which also apparently causes error as well, so I changed it to Fullscreen mode just in case).

The default resolution will be 1280 x 720 (720p resolution).

I then Quit the game, went back to the NVIDIA Control Panel, and changed the resolution to ""1920 x 1080 (1080p resolution, which is what my monitor is natively)"". IMPORTANT NOTE: I chose the one under the ""PC"" heading, NOT the option under ""Ultra HD, HD, SD"" which was what I set it to initially for my old games...

Then I ran EGS Launcher again, booted up BL3 successfully again, went to Main Menu &gt; Options &gt; Visuals &gt; set resolution to ""1920 x 1080"" so that I could play on 1080p HD resolution as per my usual gaming settings.

Hopefully this works for you as well! (Especially if you have NVIDIA graphics card. Not sure if same solution will work for AMD GPUs as I don't own a PC with that brand).",One solution to Error 88500000 message (Borderlands 3 launching/running issue),,1568608055.0,2019-09-17 04:27:35

1.Rant

I have been waiting on my support ticket in my gmail for 5 hours. Epic Games knows that with the release of Borderlands 3 the issues could be huge problem and they needed to increase their support team. But they didn't. I Have used the launcher since Paragon and its sad that at this point with how much profit Epic gets as a company that they would fix up and help out the users of its launcher. I have spent $1000's of dollars on cosmetics and games through the epic games store and this is help i get from buying their products. They have enough money to start a 100 million dollar tournament and yet they cant have a decent support team. From what I hear with some of the developers talking about how they aren't being payed overtime or they are being overworked to the point of insomnia. This makes me sympathize with the workers rather than Epic's lifeless for-profit corporate attitude.  I like how when it tells me that it has detected that my epic games launcher has crashed multiple times it redirects me to their support page that doesn't even have the error that i'm experiencing. I get more technical support from and Foreign Credit Card Scam company than Epic Games.

1600 subscribers!  It seems like every month there is another +500 subscriber milestone to be had.  A lot of that can be attributed to the fantastic array of games releasing on the storefront, like [Borderlands 3](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/borderlands-3/home) or [Control](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/control/home).

As always in these updates, I want to be able to provide the collection of information gathered about the subreddit to share with you guys, and utilize it into changes we can all enjoy.  To give you a tl;dr of each of the topics I'll talk about in this thread:

* Where is the Troubleshooting and Support megathread?
* What are all these new post flairs?
* Why do you talk so much?  I just want free games!
* I thought Borderlands 3 was supposed to flop, what happened?
* What can we expect to see in the subreddit in the near future?
* I've heard rumors, how do you guys actually moderate the subreddit?
* ...and more!

&amp;nbsp;

#Troubleshooting and Support Megathread (gone!)

One of the changes we tried in the last update was to sticky [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cno7lz/troubleshooting_support_megathread/) in hopes of centralizing issues for Epic employees and astute community members to help with, and needless to say it was not very successful.  A lot of information in the thread itself was utilized in separate troubleshooting threads, but a lot of questions (some very simple) went unanswered.  You live and you learn.

This doesn't mean the information will go to waste though!  Instead, we will be compiling all this information and more into a helpful wiki soon enough for users to quick reference.  You'll definitely hear more about that when we're ready to publish it.

&amp;nbsp;
___
#Post Flairs

What do you do when the first idea doesn't work out?  Brainstorm and come up with a better idea!  I've put together a list of several new post flairs to help users strolling find exactly what they need.  The tentative list includes:

* **QUERY [REWORKED]** - For users who have a general question about the launcher itself.  This does not apply to issues that are dampening your experience with the Epic Games Store, but rather ""How do I utilize this feature"" type questions.

* **NEED HELP!** - For users who have an issue with the Epic Games Store itself, and are having difficulty using it to its full potential.  The thread's respective poster will be able to assign this.

* **NEED MORE INFORMATION** - An issue has been identified, but not enough information has been posted about it.  This will be a flair changed by one of our lovely moderators when the issue needs a further description to continue troubleshooting.

* **SOLUTION PROVIDED** - A solution of sorts has been posted to your issue!  This doesn't necessarily mean it's the right answer, we would require feedback to make sure everything is working for you now.  Again, this will be a flair that moderators will assign if needed.

* **ISSUE RESOLVED!** - You had an issue and confirmed to us that the issue was resolved in one way or another!  These posts will absolutely help newcomers who are having the same issue as you are.  The thread's respective poster will be able to assign this once they feel they have a resolution.

* **[INSERT GAME HERE]** - We will create more post flairs for some of the more popular game discussions, because we're not entirely about troubleshooting.  One example we have right now is of Borderlands 3.

If you have any other suggestions along the way for new post flairs, please let us know!

&amp;nbsp;

#Free games!

As always, make sure to keep your eyes peeled on the [storefront](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/) for free games every week!  Rumor has it that next week could have up to 6 games... who knows?

r/100PercentDiscounts has been a wonderful Reddit-based resource to check out all the free games coming up recently.  Not limited to the Epic Games Store either, because who doesn't like free games?

&amp;nbsp;
___
#Borderlands 3

Mayhem is here!  As a reminder, there are bunch of very active communities for Borderlands 3 on Reddit (r/Borderlands and r/Borderlands3) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/borderlands)!

Regarding Borderlands 3 troubleshooting, u/arctyczyn (official Epic Games employee) has opened up a megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d3qlgz/having_epic_games_launcherborderlands_3_support/) related to all issues with the launch.  If you opened up a thread with an issue after the megathread was published, you may have noticed a comment on your post alongside it being locked/removed.  Please don't take this personally, but we want to ensure everyone gets their issue resolved as quickly as possible, and Epic Games is putting their full attention on that thread.  Posting it as a unique thread would not get your issue resolved quickly enough, and it causes more frustration for you than necessary.

&amp;nbsp;
___
#Subreddit Changes

I'm still an avid user of old Reddit, and it is quite obvious that the layout of the subreddit hasn't received as much love on this side.  I'm working as much as possible with the other moderators to refresh the look of the subreddit, so you might see some visual changes in the near future!

With the introduction of new post flairs, I would also like to utilize a search filter.  Whether it may be to turn on/off support threads, find specific discussions, or whatever, I think this would be a feature that a lot of users would enjoy to see.  I hope to see this implemented soon.

Also with the utilization of new post flairs, we'll try to work in more Automoderator uses.  Right now, Automoderator is set to immediately remove certain phrases or words that aren't tolerated.  This may be expanded to include a reminder to set a flair, or link appropriate resources with different keywords.

As mentioned before, we're beginning to establish a wiki of information!  The wiki will contain useful troubleshooting information, how to use the Epic Games Store's features, game information, and more.  Please let us know what you'd like to see in the wiki!

&amp;nbsp;

#Moderation

It should go without saying that the storefront we support on this subreddit is regarded as highly controversial within the online gaming community.  And that's perfectly fine, because everyone is entitled to support what they like, and for very valid reasons across all opinions.  But with every controversial opinion or support comes a good bit of backlash and general toxicity (you should see the modmail we get nowadays).

I'm not here to point any fingers or tell other communities how to conduct themselves, that would be highly inappropriate; as far as that is concerned, we will continue to contact the right people and handle anything that gets too far out of hand.  We moderate r/EpicGamesPC, and r/EpicGamesPC alone when it comes to this community, and we want to ensure full transparency so no one thinks we have our priorities mismatched.  If you have any questions about the way we conduct our moderation, please talk to us.  We're as human as you are, and it's nice to sit down and talk with everyone who wants to have a genuine discussion.  Just to throw this out there:

* Our moderators are not officially associated with Epic Games whatsoever.  We are active gaming community members that have our own personal purposes for supporting the Epic Games Store.

* We do not get paid in any form whatsoever to moderate this subreddit.  No, not even V-Bucks.  This is something we personally took on because no one was making a supportive effort on Reddit.

* We do not ban users solely for their participation in other related communities.  The only exception I can attest to this is linking any post from r/EpicGamesPC into another subreddit and harassing any of our members there.  We do not tolerate that whatsoever.

* Our general expectations for how our subscribers should conduct themselves fall under the Golden Rule: ""Treat others the way you want to be treated.""  We've recently been talking privately to certain users within our subreddit that are posting/commenting in a manner that we certainly wouldn't appreciate, and we will continue to enforce this.

* Every post or comment that we've removed has a reason for being removed.  If you would like to know why, please ask.  Moping and griping about it online doesn't solve your question, it only leads to needless speculation.

#Trello Board

The [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/GXLc34hk/epic-games-store-roadmap) got a complete refresh last month!  Instead of giving a vague timeframe of when to expect certain features, it is much easier to keep track of what **exactly** is coming up next.

#Closing Remarks

To give you a better idea of usernames to familiarize yourself on this subreddit:

**Moderators:**

* u/MartyFlyMac (that's me!)

* u/TickleMittz (he owns this thing)

* u/indi_n0rd (pretty sure he has been corrupted by Tencent...)

**Epic Games employees:**

* u/arctyczyn (big help!)

* u/EpicBits (completely on top of the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/GXLc34hk/epic-games-store-roadmap))

* u/DanDaDaDanDan (lurking in the shadows)

* u/TimSweeneyEpic (only the CEO of Epic Games, no big deal)

These are all the friendly names you can rely on to help you with any issues between the Epic Games Store, EGS games, or the subreddit!  You can also find a lot of ""PC Gamer"" or ""Epic Gamer"" flairs for users that we appreciate for being the best they can here.  Thank you all sincerely.

Didn't, was told I can't get refund.  Because I had spent too long ""playing""- i.e. trying to fix the broken game they sold me.

CS did not actually close ticket, I did as he said and tried opening a new ticket for further help and was immediately shut down as I had a ticket relating to issue already open.

Pinged original CS several times via email reply and got this response- https://i.imgur.com/6I8KapU.png

Have sent several more replies restating over and over the situation and that what they are trying to do is illegal.

I know the CS might LITERALLY not be able to authorize the refund, so also asked how to contact someone that could, or for him to bring this to his supervisor.  No response.

Also opened a third ticket with several requests to keep the ticket open, and explaining everything I wrote above.

WHat the heck do do know?  This first guy isn't replying anymore and my third ticket has not received any non-automated replies. Is my only option to just do a chargeback?

Borderlands 3 is the first game I've tried to use with it. Initially it just didn't do anything, it would say it was Cloud Syncing and then nothing would happen, so I turned off cloud syncing because I don't want it anyway, and then nothing would happen at all.

Click launch! Launching! Nothing happens.

So I tried rebooting.

And now it says it can't find an ""entry point"" because of a DLL.

I tried verifying game files. Still broken.

It has *one job*.

Support haven't got back to me. Does anyone have a fix for this, or do I just demand a refund and wait for the Steam version?",The Epic Games Launcher has ONE JOB...,,1568389549.0,2019-09-14 15:45:49

Most of my game time last night was spent in the menus trying different graphical settings because the game kept crashing for me no matter which I switched up, checked drivers, etc. Its not like I'm trying to take advantage of the situation, I just can't seem to get it working well without excessive crashing and tremendous spikes the very little time I did play over 2 hours.

The website won't load. It jumps between two states. Sometimes, the website just plain won't load; the formatting and background color load in, then it just keeps non-stop refreshing. Other times, my browser (Chrome) says it's not a safe website. Whatever, I let it through anyway. Then it gives me a 404 error because evidently the website does not exist.

It's possible that the two issues are unrelated, but no other application on my computer thinks I'm missing internet connection, so I doubt it.

Hello Guys,

so basically I've bought the Game via Gamivo, super quick transaction and got the key right away - no problem so far.

I then redeemed it on the Epic Games Redeem-Site - again no problem, key was being recognized.

After aprox. 7h of my shitty internet downloading the game the Button under the thumbnail say ""GET"", clicking on it  
redirects me to the store page where i could obtain the game - again ?!

Implying that something went wrong Ive both contacted Epic Games and Gamivo Support - either not really helpful at all.

Ive saw another post regarding the exact same issue on here somewhere.

In addition, my friend who I got the game for, has the exact same problem too.

&amp;#x200B;

I know everyone is super eager to hop in and play Borderlands 3 (so am I). For those of you visiting here for the first time with support issues, I'm on the Epic Games store team and I can address a few issues at a time.  The proper path for fielding support issues is through our Player Support team. In some scenarios, especially those experienced after successfully downloading the game from the Epic Games store, it may be in your best interest to contact 2K support.

&amp;#x200B;

* Epic Games launcher/ Epic Games store purchasing issues: [Contact Epic Games Player Support](https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/epic-games-store-and-launcher/)
* Game specific crashes, issues after downloading the game: [Contact 2K Support](https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003831093-Borderlands-3)

&amp;#x200B;

We're also looking into a number of key resellers and issues that players are having with redeeming keys. In many cases our recommendation is to contact the key reseller if the product is not showing up correctly. You can send me a DM with the key you redeemed, however I may redirect you to the respective key reseller.

Just today I purchased Borderlands 3, but in my excitement I forgot that my Epic Games account was never verificated and since playing Fortnite more than one year ago I have also deleted the email associated with the account. There is no way to recover the email-account (I've checked with google) so I'm kind of stuck. I can still access the account and play games, but I'm unable to change any account settings.  
I've sent two tickets to change my email to Epic Support and one to ask for a refund for Borderlands 3. Does anyone here know if this refund will be able to go through without having access to the email? I have given my new email in the support ticket, but if the answer is automated that won't help much right? Further, does anyone else have experience with this kind of problem? Did it get fixed?

1568379665,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/d3ox47/download_corrupting_itself/,"I have been trying to fix this since yesterday.

I start the download. It verifies the install size. It begins downloading. Anywhere from 30-60% of the way through, it stops and goes to verify again. The total amount to download increases anywhere from 10% to 80%. This happens 2-4 times. The largest I saw this was a 250gb estimated download for a 50gb game. Eventually, during the download, and error pops up letting me know that my download was corrupted and that I should try again.

I have searched the internet and found about a dozen posts about this kind of thing over the past 2 years. There were a couple of solutions posted anywhere, and none have worked for me.

I have tried: Running EGS as admin, rebooting my PC, reinstalling EGS, letting the download sit and continue, installing Fortnite and then the game (it worked for one guy??), flushing DNS, adding a few launch parameters to the EGS shortcut (from a Youtube video - one was ""-OpenGL"", don't recall the other), launching an installed copy of the game files from an external HDD, dragging those files into my default directory before launching from there, and starting the download, pausing it, copying those files into the created directory, and continuing the install from there.

For the record, with Fortnite, that game had the same issue with installing. I tested a few games on Steam and those all installed fine, so this is an EGS issue.

I will basically try anything at this point. One guy I spoke with earlier said that letting it sit and install worked eventually (30gb more than it should have downloaded but it worked). I just want to play the game I paid for.",Download corrupting itself,,1568336465.0,2019-09-14 01:01:05

Back when Tim knew what customer service was.

For the past two days, I have been working tirelessly to try and get a bug logged with the store's interface. It notified me that the transaction threw an error. Ok, I thought if it was denied; I wouldn't see the transaction in Amex site. Except the purchase is showing as pending in my Amex account. Odd must have just been a glitch I'll try again. SO I did, Still no game and a new pending charge. Four times this goes one through the different interfaces in case it was the desktop software. Or I entered the wrong CVN. which is the only piece of info I had to give.

So giving up on the purchase I contact ""support"" to have the charges dropped and have a bug filed. Now I'll admit I was steaming at this point so was not kind. A good customer service employee would recognize this and try to de-escalate the situation. Nope. Good old Tristan. He keeps the fires burning and made me even madder by telling me I am mistaken that I had to have entered the info wrong. *the CVN which I checked and knew by heart.* And that pending means there might be insufficient funds in the account it is a credit card that is nowhere near its limit. Or that the Credit card isn't set up for online purchases. I use the card online every day and pay for things way more expensive than games with it. I have since blown a fuse. I will admit, I did lose my cool with the support agent. That was my bad. I have asked for a manager; he is the only one who can help me according to him. If that is the case, then epic has a significant problem. Escalations are a substantial part of customer service.

At this point, I'll wait the year for the game to come out on steam. And Epic will never see another cent of my money. I tried giving them the benefit of the doubt. But the horror stories are true.

1567613075,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/czmumn/update_on_problem_uninstalling_egs_resulting_in/,"Hey all! I'm glad Epic has been putting much greater effort into improving their store client. This can hopefully be seen as constructive feedback from my experience and testing.

There’s an inherent problem with EGS. If you uninstall the client, it will uninstall all of your EGS games for no reason. A second problem is that if you install EGS, it won’t recognize any of the EGS games you had already previously installed. (For example, if you had to uninstall/reinstall EGS due to a glitch.) Thus, you won’t be able to launch the games from the client library. The only option in the library is to install the games even though they’re already installed. So I contacted tech support about the second problem.

&amp;nbsp;


**TECH SUPPORT:** *""I appreciate the detailed explanation that you have provided. However, I'm sorry to inform you that Player Support will be unable to directly impact on this issue. As a solution, I would suggest either deleting the games completely and installing them through the launcher or simply starting them from the their locations.*

*I apologise for any caused inconvenience and thank you for the understanding.""*

&amp;nbsp;

**IOW:** Either don't use EGS client to launch games. Therefore, run the games directly from the program directory in Windows. Or uninstall/reinstall every game so that the client can recognize them. Which you will have to do if you ever have to reinstall the EGS client again.**

I ran some tests, and here are my findings. Basically, you can install the EGS client to any directory on your PC. Then, use the client to install games to any directory as well. EGS will know where all the games are, and be able to launch them no problem.

&amp;nbsp;

**PROBLEM 1:** If you uninstall EGS, it will uninstall all of your EGS games. This needs to be fixed. Right now, you can prevent this by changing the name of the directories of each game. Or move your games elsewhere. Both solutions will cause the EGS client to not recognize your games are even installed. And you can safely uninstall the client without your games being affected.

Once EGS is uninstalled, all of your games should work fine. You can run them all normally directly from their respective directories. No launcher required. All of your game directories will have the "".egstore"" folder within them. This folder is unnecessary when running games without EGS client. Thus, you can even get rid of that folder if not planning to use EGS client for the game.

**Note:** The shortcut created by EGS during installation of any game is not directed to the actual game executable file in Windows. It is set to launch the EGS client, which will then launch the game.

&amp;nbsp;

**PROBLEM 2:** This is the problem I had contacted tech support about. After installing EGS client, it doesn’t recognize games you already have installed. Even though the games are already fully installed, and working properly without the client. Normally, the client library shows all of your installed games with “LAUNCH” as the option. However, since they’re not recognized, they all show “INSTALL” as the option.

Proceeding to install the game in the directory that the game is already installed in will not even result in the client recognizing that the game is already fully installed. In fact, it won’t even try to replace the installation. You will get an error that the directory is full. Regardless of how much space you have available.

Trying to run the installation to only get the "".egstore"" folder doesn’t work either. The idea is to run the second installation of the game so you only get that folder, and stop the installation from installing the entire rest of the game. Therefore, the new "".egstore"" folder can replace the old one inside the original game directory. The launcher should be able to find it, and recognize your game is installed.

This actually works, but only if you can get the new "".egstore"" folder. First of all, you have to direct the second installation to the directory your original installation is in. Therefore, you can’t direct it somewhere else such as the desktop. Because the new "".egstore"" folder will tell the launcher that the game is on the desktop. Which we don’t want. Thus, you have to temporarily rename the original installation folder to something else. This way, you can proceed with the second installation to the proper directory without getting the error. Once you have the new "".egstore"" folder, replace the old one with it inside the original game directory. Then, delete the new installation, and set the original directory back to the proper name. EGS will successfully recognize the original installation.

The problem with this is that you can’t get the "".egstore"" folder without fully installing the game again. During installation, all the files go through the "".egstore"" folder. You won’t get the proper actual folder until the installation is complete. This nullifies the entire point of avoiding having to reinstall all of your games.

&amp;nbsp;

**PROBLEM 3?:** I’m not sure about this as it only applies to two games that I don’t own. **”The Sinking City”** and **”Shakedown Hawaii”**. Somebody informed me about this, so if anybody can please double check, I’d be interested to know what is going on.

Basically, as far as Epic has stated, EGS doesn’t have any sort of inherent DRM like Steam. So like normal PC game shops, EGS has nothing to do with DRM on any of the games in the shop. If a game uses DRM, it’s because the dev invested into applying it to the game on their own. But DRM is never applied through EGS. This is the reason all of your EGS games are able to be played without the use of EGS client. As described throughout this topic. Therefore, you can completely shut down (or uninstall) the client, and the games can run normally offline from their directory in Windows. (The exception being games made for online play that need to connect to the internet through the EGS client).

However, from what I understand, the following games aren’t working without the EGS client:

**The Sinking City**

**Shakedown Hawaii**

Since I don’t own them, I can’t check. If somebody can double check this by running those games directly from Windows with EGS off, that would be great. It would be good to know what is going on.",Update on problem uninstalling EGS resulting in uninstalling games. And reinstalling EGS not recognizing installed games.,,1567569875.0,2019-09-05 04:04:35

I dont expect anything about that account its gone but am heartbroken because my sister is very sad about the account she played and on, and about the money she lost that she have been saving for a while to get a rare account.

&amp;nbsp;

**BACKGROUND:** Let's say, for the sake of normal human convenience, you have 3 drives.

Drive 1 (c:) - Main SSD drive for OS and certain fast paced games, but not very large.

Drive 2 (d:) - Large drive with enough space for most application installations.

Drive 3 (a:) - Huge file storage drive.

&amp;nbsp;

So EGS application itself installs to its own folder on the (c:) drive on any system by default. As do all games. However, I changed the location for the installation to a folder in Drive 2 dedicated to all program files. Likewise, many games are directed to be installed in another folder in drive 2 for games. While others are installed in a similar folder in Drive 1. OK so EGS launcher keeps track of where all these games are installed. So when you launch EGS, it will check those locations, and show in your library that those games are installed so you can launch them. But where is this information? Because if EGS forgets for any game, how can we tell it where the game is located?

&amp;nbsp;

Let's say for whatever reason, EGS forgets where all the games are. For example, you were experiencing some run of mill glitches. Thereby, uninstalled EGS. Then reinstalled it. But after reinstalling, EGS has no idea where any of the games are. So if you go to your library, it will show all the games in your account. But none of them will have the ""LAUNCH"" button. They will all have the ""INSTALL"" button. Because EGS doesn't recognize any of them as installed in the default location. Even though they are all already installed, and working properly.

You can launch every game normally from their actual respective program folders. Even create direct shortcuts. But you cannot launch them from the launcher. It doesn't recognize any of them as installed. Therefore, if you click on any game in the library, it will try to install an additional copy of the game. And if you try to direct it to install in the same folder it's already in, it will still not recognize that the installation is already there. Nor will it try to replace the installation. It will give an error that there's no space to install the game.

&amp;nbsp;

Which means, I can never launch any of the games from the EGS launcher. Unless of course, I just uninstall the games, and reinstall them. And do so every time I have to uninstall/reinstall the launcher.

&amp;nbsp;

Please fix this. EGS is great as a store, and bringing more integrity to PC game industry. However, aside from many kinks in the launcher, this needs to be addressed.",Message from EGS tech support. Platform is inherently broken. This needs to be fixed ASAP.,,1567457383.0,2019-09-03 20:49:43

&amp;#x200B;

For my part I recently got a purchase receipt on my Epic Games Account when I have stopped using fortnite and was wondering what had happened. I went on my epic games account and saw someone had indeed purchased 1K bucks on behalf of myself and connected a nintendo switch.  


My first reflex was to change my password on all my accounts in case I was breached. I then contacted support which asked me to give some information:  


&gt;  
1. Email address associated with your Epic Games account  
2. Current Epic Games account display name  
3. First and last names of Epic Games account holder  
4. External account currently connected to your Epic Games account, if applicable.  


After giving those information I got a reply saying they needed more information:  


&gt;• Any IP addresses (IPv4) you have logged in from.   
You can find your  public IP address on the net. Just use your search engine and type  something like "" what's my IP address"" then choose one of the provided  sites and you got it.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Date when you created your Epic Games account.   
For  that you can check your email account. There should be an email from  Epic Games on the date you created your account, if you haven't deleted  it yet. If you can't find the email, you can answer this approximately.   
&gt;  
&gt;•  An invoice ID for any Epic Games purchase you made on the account (the  Invoice ID begins with an ""A,"" followed by 8 digits; example: A12345678)  
You  will have an email to your inbox that includes an Invoice , only if you  had made a purchase something through Epic store. If you do not have  one it is ok.   
&gt;  
&gt;• Locations (city, state/province) where you made purchases on the account  
&gt;  
&gt;• Original display name for the account  
&gt;  
&gt;• Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the account. Only if you had made a purchase through Epic store.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Date of your last login  
&gt;  
&gt;•  Names of any PlayStation, Switch, Twitch, or Xbox accounts connected to  your Epic Games account and the dates when they were connected

After giving those information support ""bot"" asked me again saying I hadn't given all information.  


While the support didn't show any care about player security and this time sensitive matter. The hacker was able to reuse the exploit again.

&amp;#x200B;

He then (even after I had enabled two factor authentification):

\- Bought another Item on the store

\- Deleted my Playstation Network Account linked to my account 

\- Added his nintendo switch again

&amp;#x200B;

I have now requested the deletion of my account and wrote this to warn people about this exploit which epic games is not investigating.",Exploit allows user to hijack your accounts via nintendo switch,,1566909543.0,2019-08-28 12:39:03

[Bye Epic!](https://i.redd.it/sj3ftb0uemh31.jpg)

So i was skeptical of all the complaints and was enjoying my games on the Epic store, until i pre-purchased Tetris Effect which was supposed to come with an extra DLC (wallpapers and music), the day came and i downloaded Tetris and it was awesome, but there was no DLC... so i contact support and they have the balls to tell me 3 days later they didnt know what the problem was and that i should contact the game developer, despite my surprise at this answer i go ahead and write Tetris support and they tell me its an Epic Store issue, so i contact support again and guess what? they tell me 2 days later they dont know about it, wow! just wow! i go ahead an ask for a refund on Tetris Effect, 3 days later the ticket is closed with no answer, and an email immediately after they ask me to rate the service, serisouly??? i go ahead and make another ticket for a refund, 2 day later the ticket is closed and a rate service email arrives, come on now... i went to the Epic Store website and asked for a refund on every game i have ever purchased (more than $100), 4 day later someone contacted me asking me why i was processing all the refunds, told her i was deleting my account, and so i did, my money was refunded successfully and i no longer plan on open an account with Epic ever again! i dont care about their free games or exclusives, Steam support has replied and fixed my problems in one day, there is no reason for a support team to be this useless.

***1. The EGS gives our personal data to the Chinese Government.***

Yes, because the Chinese government needs the personal data of people playing Fortnite and World War Z. If they don't know who ""idonthavelife92"" is, it will be a big blow at the diplomatic level. Even if this **ridiculous** claim was true, it is more so for Americans who have a trade war with China. For some it is okay for US companies to steal our data, but for Chinese companies it is bad. For us Europeans, however, the China-US war must be indifferent.

***2. Yes but EGS does not have features in store like the competition.***

EGS is a new store. Epic Games is slowly integrating all the features needed to make its store fully operational and have nothing less than competition.

***3. But I don't want to have many launchers on the computer, I want my games in one store.***

According to this allegation, there should be no CDs either. But this is not in the interest of the consumer, as reduced competition leads to monopolies. It's not that difficult to click and log into EGS. However, if you find it so hard to click, don't complain about others wanting more games on different launchers.

***4. Yes but Epic Store has exclusives, isn't this a monopoly?***

No, that's the definition of competition. Epic Store makes deals with devs without forcing them to do anything. They are free to sign the agreement and not to sign it. Epic Games Store aims to give 88% of the game's price back to the developers, which means they get what they deserve from the games. On the contrary, some fanboys [threatened developers](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-08-05-ooblets-dev-received-thousands-of-hateful-threatening-messages-over-epic-exclusivity) not to sign exclusive deals, which is not free competition, but a criminal offense.",Allegations against EGS are examined and answered,,1566247282.0,2019-08-20 20:41:22

They ask me to provide information regarding the account, I provide it to the best of my ability as the account was made in 2016, and then they continue to state that the information I provided wasn't matching their ""records."" As I stated above, I have every email from the inception of that account, receipts from my PayPal of the two purchases I made on the account; emails when I linked my PS4, Xbox, and twitch, and then emails when those accounts were unlinked when my account was hacked. I have given this all to support and they still refuse to help me. Is there any way to get in contact with someone at epic games who can actually help me. This whole ordeal has just been so frustrating as I have almost all of the information Epic has asked for, apart from the original IP address that was used on the account and also the og display that I had used, as the account was created in 2016 and I really don't remember. Please if anybody can help me gain access to my account, or put me in contact with someone other than bots at this point, I will greatly appreciate it.

1565282127,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cno7lz/troubleshooting_support_megathread/,"#Introduction

While this community revolves around discussion regarding the Epic Games Store and its positives, it is also important to understand that it is a great work in progress, and things aren't going to necessarily work a lot of time.  A hefty amount of threads in this subreddit relate around troubleshooting issues regarding the Epic Games Store, launcher, and respective games.  We appreciate all the help that the community has given users as these threads pop up, but today we're going to try out a new format to help centralize troubleshooting information, clean up some clutter, and hopefully help out new users that may be experiencing similar issues.

&amp;nbsp;

Throughout the rest of this post will be a compiled list of some of the most frequently asked questions or issues brought up in the subreddit, with previous working solutions provided by Epic Games developers or community members.  Throughout the duration of testing this new format, we will ask for users to ask questions related to technical problems in the comments of this thread, rather than a new post completely.  For those who are uninformed and/or create a new troubleshooting thread, the post will be hidden *but* linked to in this thread.

&amp;nbsp;

Comments will be sorted by new so that the newer questions are pushed towards the top of the list.  As solutions come around for newly introduced issues, this post will be updated so that users may refer to it if they have the same problem.  Our intentions again for this new format are to help new users find troubleshooting solutions quicker, reduce the clutter of troubleshooting threads in this subreddit, and help the studious developers/community members resolve unanswered issues quicker.  As always, if you have any questions or concerns with this new format, we're all ears and looking for feedback, whether positive or negative.

#General Q&amp;A

#####Constantly receiving password reset emails | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/b99rwd/password_reset_mails_each_and_every_week/)

&gt;If you have ensured the security of both your EGS account, and **especially** the related email account, those password reset emails are completely useless to an attacker.  Do not click the link to reset the password if you did not authorize it, and instead delete it.


#####Refund Policy | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/b92x8f/i_need_help/)

&gt;Your game is eligible for a refund if **you've owned it for 14 days or less** and **played less than 2 hours** during that time period.  More information regarding the Refund Policy can be found [here](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/store-refund-policy), and a refund request can be submitted on the [Customer Service page](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/customer-service).

#####Account Security | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/be3ca2/help_with_hack_prevention/) • [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bx8xcb/epic_games_launcher_account_apparently_hacked/) • [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bx2m8p/epic_games_account_hacked_but_i_dont_understand/) • [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bule2t/whats_happening_and_should_i_be_worried_about_my/) • [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cipl6s/epic_games_store_password_security/)

&gt;Ensure you have taken the proper measures to secure all related accounts.  **Enabling 2FA** and using unique passwords on different accounts are the best countermeasures to prevent attackers from accessing your account.

&gt;Double-check to make sure any of your known credentials for your email or EGS account have not be compromised [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

&gt;If you believe your account may be logged in elsewhere, even though you changed your credentials, contact Epic Games Support and ask them to log out of all sessions.

#####Playing Games Offline | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/b2pqqr/whats_the_point_of_needing_an_internet_connection/) • [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bge9gd/how_do_i_go_into_offline_mode_on_the_epic_games/)

&gt;When signing in to the Epic Games Launcher, you can select the option **Sign In Later** to load your game offline.  More information can be found [here](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/news/launcher-offline-mode).

#####Finding a game's file size | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bph9hu/why_does_the_store_not_tell_us_file_sizes_or_is/)

&gt;Towards the bottom of the game's store page, look for the **Storage** information in the **Specifications** section.

#####Creator Code affiliate link issues | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bwr68y/creator_code_link_not_working/)

&gt;Send an email to supportacreator@epicgames.com with your Affiliate name so the Epic Games team can further assist.

#####Retaining saves after uninstalling a game | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/c8hfjh/if_i_delete_transistor_will_the_epic_game/) • [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/c2uizy/if_i_delete_a_game_and_install_again_will_my_save/) • [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cnk073/deleting_games_saves/)

&gt;Until cloud saves are officially implemented for the game in question, we cannot guarantee any saves will be retained for the future.

#####2FA codes not being sent immediately | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/c5xdh5/security_code_takes_too_long_to_arrive/)

&gt;We would recommend using an alternative 2FA application like Google Authenticator to immediately receive 2FA codes.  More information can be found [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/2fa).

#####Claiming the free weekly games through mobile | [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/ceq0yj/is_there_a_way_to_claim_the_free_weekly_games_on/)

1565281819,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cno4yp/epics_free_stuff/,"I was thinking about this for a while. While I appreciate what Epic is trying to do (ie. break Steam's monopoly on PC gaming) it is doing this by 1) leveraging their Fortnight popularity \[why not!\], 2) freebies \[again...why not!\] and 3) Exclusives \[mmmm.... not too keen on this but understand why they are doing this\]. I personally have and use Steam alot and have a massive game library. Now in saying this I also have GOG, uPlay, Origin &amp; [Battle.net](https://Battle.net)....so personally I have given up on having only one game launcher!.....I will say I am looking forward to GOG2 to see what happens here (one game launcher to rule them all perhaps!). I don't want to discuss points 1\] or 3\] as there is a lot of discussion on these topics for better or worse....however I wanted to talk about item 2) that is Epic's game store approach to freebies!.

Developers would obviously be paid/reimbursed for the giveaways via Epic Store (essentially Epic will pay the licences to Developers to provide their games Free of Charge). This seems OK, however as they are doing this a lot with Indie titles, it begs the question...are Indie developers suffering from this? I mean, as a price conscious gamer, I may decide not to buy any indie titles, as Epic are giving away them free every two weeks! I mean, what if i just bought a title on Steam and then 1 month later it is given away free! (for me Personally this happened with Moonlighter was given away....I only bought it about a month earlier!). So following this, I should personally hold off on buying any indie titles until Epic decide not to give away freebies anymore (they can't afford to keep doing it forever!....or can they?) and then just play it via their Store.

Or do I buy it now on Steam and hope that it isn't given away free on Epic next month!! The last Indie game I purchased on Steam was 'My Friend Pedro' when it was released....so what if Epic give this away in October? How would I feel? Do I learn my lesson and not buy any more for a while in the hope that it comes out for free? 

Personally if you play Fortnight you have Epic Store, so really i am not losing too much in having t in Epic store (in the long term)...short term (that is a bit of a different story). So I might as well wait? right?

Or I can simply keep ""clicking Purchase for Free"" on Epic for every game made available (even if I already have it on Steam!)....over time my library will increase using Epic to a point that I will not mind switching between both game launchers.  (This is what Epic is hoping for!)..... get enough people with enough games...so that in the end people don't care what launcher is used (fingers crossed for GOG2!).....

However what about people that didn't get a few of the free games? maybe they missed out on some of the early titles or for a couple of releases simply forgot? ***If Epic was smart they will make the back-catalog available for everyone one more time before they store to give away items that people may have missed***! This will then bring up people up to the same level as most people with a lower number of freebies on their account...this will mean that all users will have the same and latest games and a good community can develop!! More people can collaborate (when the software and systems are available!) and get behind certain games...

What do you think about Indie giveaways? or Epic maybe giving their back catalogue of older games all away to allow users who missed out on some games to complete their collection! Once this happens 'critical mass' would have been achieved and people will jump onto Epic more without all the fuss and fanfair!",Epic's Free Stuff,,1565238619.0,2019-08-09 04:30:19

I'm not sure how many of you are actually in China, and I'm not sure how well this culturally translates, but **you have lost serious face over this**.

I'm very certain that your lawyers put something in your contract stipulating that the activities of the developers - not to mention your CEO! - cannot do harm to your company. From a public relations perspective, the combination of ""you're a bunch of entitled, toxic manbabies"" and ""we're going to Epic"" is probably one of the most harmful combinations I can think of. You *do* ***not*** want to be seen as the place where developers go if they hate the people buying their products; it obviously turns off your customers, but it turns off developers as well. Indie devs are going to see this mess and go ""Woah. Crap. We really do not want to appear this way to the game-buying public.""

After I gave up with it for a bit (organizing 121 games is a tad tedious), I decided to do one for Epic given that the collection of games is more limited compared to Steam atm.

Here's what I came up with (organized from what I want to buy the most to what I want to buy the least):

## S Tier

* Borderlands 3
* Outer Wilds
* The Outer Worlds
* John Wick Hex

## A Tier

* Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines 2
* Solar Ash Kingdom

## B Tier

* Satisfactory
* Mechwarrior 5
* WHAT THE GOLF?
* Ghostbusters Remastered

## C Tier

* Rebel Galaxy Outlaw
* Control

## D Tier

* World War Z
* Phoenix Point
* Dangerous Driving
* Untitled Goose Game
* Super Meat Boy Forever

## E Tier

* Heavy Rain

## F Tier

* Anno 1800
* Watch Dogs Legion

Next, he suspected that his account may have been hacked. I thought that this was weird, as what he told me was that there was no email ever sent to him from epic in regards to his password and/or email being changed by someone, so I don't think his account was hacked.

Also, he is no longer on my friend and Is friends list on epic games, which is weird.

He has been communicating with epic games, giving them information they asked for such as receipts of purchase, ip address, last login date and the reply he got back was that he was ""unable to provide the correct information that we need to proceed with your request"".

1564528145,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/cjzr56/my_account_was_hacked_i_got_it_back_but_epic_help/,"So this tale starts Sunday morningish when I'm a little drunk slash not at my computer. I get two notifications from epic that my PSN has been taken down and two set authentication  has been activated. So When i get back to my place, i had epic store logged in on my computer and get a bit of access to my account. To which i change my password and send epic a help email. During the password switch, it now prompts me for a second code sent to the (hackers) phone.  When i hear back i get a long list of things i have to verify. The list was:  


 • Your public IP address(es) (IPv4), which you can find by searching ""What is my IP address"" in your internet browser; if you use multiple devices, please include all IP addresses  
• Date when you created your Epic Games account  
• Locations (city, state/province) where you made purchases on the account  
• Original display name for the account  
• Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the account  
• Date of your last login  
• Names of any PlayStation, Switch, Twitch, or Xbox accounts connected to your Epic Games account and the dates when they were connected  
• The invoice ID or transaction number from your Epic Games purchase  
\--The invoice ID is located at the top of your Epic Games receipt and begins with an ""A,"" followed by eight (8) or nine (9) digits; example: A12345678.  
\--The transaction number can be found in your emailed Xsolla receipt. Please note that the number is a nine-digit string starting with a “4” or “5.”  
   
So i go about answering the questions the best i can but I'm a little drunk and have to work at 6 am. I don't get all the things but enough that they should have been able to verify me or at least notice i been hacked. The next day i get an email that said they can't verify me and i need to redo the list of things. I'm annoyed but cool and respond that i am working a ten hour shift and if he could just freeze my visa or paypal till i get home. Email back said No we cant do that till we verify that its you.   


At this point, Im hot and hung over. Been working in the sun and starting to get paranoid that i had enabled auto pay. So i post that there is no good reason that they couldn't ensure my credit or paypal wasn't being used and that i would be sharing this on facebook or whatever. They email me back saying hey we treat everyone equally and they were going help me out if i could tell them what season of fortnite i started playing (idk), what my display name was (idk) and what the last ip i used was....  


I went home to finally sit down and try to really figure this out as well as call visa and paypal to protect myself. When i try logging onto epic store just for giggles, I notice that two step authentication has an email option (drunk the last time). I use it and get my account back. I notice that i didn't have paypal on auto purchase (thank God). I notice that i have some new friends with Arabic writing in my friends section. When looking around my account i notice that sunday i agreed to a Eula that was in Arabic for Fortnite. Before this everyone of my responses were nice and professional. This one was not but i didn't swear. And i only called them a Dumbie once. I Pointed out that there was a million red flags that my account was hacked. Like suddenly I'm reading a different language and in a different country.  I ask if i could leave a complaint with his department.....  


There response was we can't help you till you verify your account. We won't ""freeze"" payments till you verify your account. We exchanged responses today about 6ish times. Non as mean as yesterday from me but just me trying to explain how upset i am about the whole thing and them just telling me i need to verify my account. 

My whole take away from this is I'm going to delete my account with epic and not use there service. It is insane that they stonewalled me and ignored what i was saying. Its insane that if you emailed them saying you think your account was hacked they wont freeze payments. If they would have just said that no transations can be made on my account while this was sorted out i would have been happy. I'm just a dumb Nova Scotian, sheet metal worker but this shit was too much.

Is Epic's security really this much of a joke that they don't even have a proper first line of defense or am I doing something wrong?

My password on EGS is and has always been completely different from any other logins I use so the point of weakness must be coming from their end.

Does anyone else have a similar issue? I brought it up to their customer support but got diddly squat from them (the usual ""change your password"").

Obviously, a controller is highly recommended, and why not plug in my Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. I know that the controller can be a little funky when plugged into to the ol PC tower, but that hasn't been an issue for a long time, given Steam's controller integration and setup. However, once I launched Moonlighter, (with the controller plugged in and steam active, allowing my to use outside of steam) it reverted back to the ol ""I'm having a stroke, and you can't stop me"" mode, where all buttons are being registered as being pressed in rapid succession. An issue that seems to only be happening within games launched from the epic launcher. 

Upon further inspection it doesn't appear that the launcher comes with any integrated controller support in the same fashion, and the road map for the store doesn't appear to list it anywhere as an upcoming feature.

I would like to start my questions with: Am I being a literal ape and missing something? Am I stupid?

If I'm not brain dead, is there a good fix for this? Preferably I would rather not have to use some sketchy third party shenanigans to get it to work, but if it comes down to it, sure I'll try it. 

I thought maybe if I added the game to my steam library via the button that reads ""add a game"", the controller support through steam would take care of it from there, but it doesn't show up by default.  I then realized that I didn't know where it was downloaded on my computer, and the way I would normally find where a game is located, via browsing a game's properties, as far as I'm aware, isn't an option through the epic launcher either? Idk, I figured I'd ask where epic games games actually go while I'm asking about controller support.

**RECAP:**  Did I miss anything for June 2019?  Please let me know and I'll gladly add it to this post!  I hope to do a new stickied thread each month with updated information that Epic Games Store users would like to see.

**FLAIRS:**  We have added two new user flairs:  ""Mods"" and ""Epic Games""!  Initially, the ""Mods"" flair is to distinguish subreddit moderators in a post or comment.  More importantly, we've had some Epic Games employees lurking in the subreddit and providing feedback and more, and we wanted to acknowledge them as trustworthy and reliable sources of information pertaining to the Epic Games Store!

**FEEDBACK:**  We'll also have another discussion thread towards the end of the month specifically for r/EpicGamesPC, we have a lot of talk about and want feedback for how things will work in the future.

1560013009,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bya01e/pc_gaming_is_more_than_steam_feedback/,"I joined the Epic family back in March. I have some opinion and feedback about Epic Games Store which I wanted to share. 

More cash flow into PC Gaming market is always good. Now, more important when some companies even Blizzard is switching assets into mobile gaming. People hate change and going out their safe zone. It's understandable. They love Steam to death but they are living in the past. Valve has been a shell of its former self. They nearly killed the modding community with their paid mod debacle. People seems to forget it's yet another ""greedy"" company and that they are in the business for money not charity. Also Steam sales or most retailer sales actually have been lackluster for years.

Now my detailed feedback;

**Games:**

* Good catalogue with curated content so far.
* More console exclusives are being ported into PC.
* No shitty indies, early access hell, adult-hentai games kinda embarrassing crap.
* Epic is still helping out good indies with their exclusivity deals. (Kine, Rune 2 etc.)
* I don't know if this intended but some of the games are **DRM Free** which you are able to launch directly from their executables.

**Prices:**

* Universally good priced games &amp; deals for now.
* Regional pricing is very decent for low GDP countries.

**Exclusivity:**

Epic should be considered publisher and developer's partner. Another level in the product chain.  Buying exclusivity right is okay guys. They should just not snag games which are already on sale on other platforms. It's good that they said they won't do that again.

**EGS Client:**

* EGS' UI look &amp; feel is done right. It's maybe the best in the market imo.
* It's only lacking some features but it'll only get better from here.
* I can understand shopping cart being secondary because there are not even 60 (?) games in the store. Most of them were given as freebies.
* EGS have been doing right with pushing for a large playerbase. Increasing frequency of freebies was really nice. Lots of my protesting friends started FOMO'ing in the Mega Sale. Keep on doing what you're doing!

Lastly, this subreddit needs more promotion. Maybe mods should ask to collaborate with various Fornite subreddits. You can't find this subreddit on the search engines.

One was a English written name that I don't remember, the other was a Japanese name (I know cause I was studying Japanese last year). I declined and thought of it as someone misspelling my nickname. Last week my name got changed to this Japanese written name ゆういずごっど. I tried googling it but nothing came up. I was expecting to see my name when trying to translate it. That was not the case. Just in case I deleted my credit card info and sent a token to Epic Games Support, which was useless.

I had email authentication turned on for the account (which was still enabled after I'd regained access to the account), and my email address has not been compromised. The password I was using was very strong and was unique to my Epic Games account.

How were they able to get in and change the password, given that they wouldn't have been able to click the link in the password reset email? Why didn't the email authentication do anything?

**WHAT IS THIS ABOUT AGAIN?**


As mentioned in the previous [concerns thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/b9gp7d/concerns_and_the_roadmap_forward/), we wanted to centralize any concerns or negative opinions in one area to hopefully promote healthy discussion, which seemed to work out well the first time.  There are genuine concerns to be discussed regarding this subreddit's focus, and we don't want to suppress/censor that whatsoever.  We just ask to keep it localized in this here thread, and be polite about it.  The people working behind Epic Games are people too, and they deserve the same basic respect as you or I.


**LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR**


This subreddit is not officially affiliated with Epic Games or the Epic Games Store, it's one of the first things written in the sidebar.  So regarding issues along the lines of...

* I need my account unbanned
* Could y'all do X to the store
* You guys are shilling out to Tim

...we cannot do anything about, or is completely untrue.  Our tight-knit moderation team just want to provide a community for Epic Games/Epic Games Store discussion without the general toxicity or scrutiny delivered by the vocal minority.


**DISCORD**


We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/37NMft5)!  Kinda empty right now, but general questions that community members can answer will most likely be answered quicker in there compared to a new Reddit thread.  We are also open to the idea of different channels within the server for the different games everyone is playing, or we can recommend their official communities.


**WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?**


A lot has changed since the last concerns thread.  We have a new moderator, hello u/indi_n0rd!  AutoModerator has also been hard at work, removing threads with certain keywords or new accounts intending to troll.  We've also put our foot down to people being blatant scumbags or disrespectful.  We're not going to tolerate it, and we don't want to be associated with those who feel like being an asshole is the only emotion you want to express.


**WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO?**


If it works, don't break it - the way things are going right now, I feel like we're keeping a good balance of healthy discussion without suppressing genuine concerns.  We might fine tune AutoModerator to provide more reasons for thread removal.  For example:  a thread regarding a question about Fortnite would be given a response along the lines of ""Unfortunately your thread has been removed...please visiting r/FortniteBR for more information!""  In June, I will also (finally) be beginning a monthly thread of ""What's happening this month"" for features/games releases from the Epic Games Store.  As things pop up, that thread will be updated so you don't miss out on anything.


**RESPONDING TO LAST CONCERNS**


* u/tacoim gave suggestions regarding improving the Epic Games Store.  I hope between my response in the first concerns thread, and the disclaimer I acknowledged above, helps bring a better understanding that there are things we are not responsible for.

* u/xtreemmasheen3k2 shares his appreciation for this community's existence.  We're not here to be like ""Epic Games rocks, Steam sucks,"" we all have our preference and opinion of launchers, and we just want to keep things level-headed.

* u/JustHere8711 says we do not give a shit, and that we (the mods) are going to censor you with our seedy practices.  Thank you AutoModerator, very cool!

1558682929,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/bsdy8z/troubles_with_the_launcher_and_now_my_games_are/,"I've contacted Epic Games support about this, but so far, no answer. Let me elaborate how the thing started

On May 23rd, I noticed some troubles about my Epic Games Launcher. Basically most screens were BLACK and when I clicked on the tabs, nothing happened. The games started so far (I tried with Subnautica), so I thought it was an issue with my internet conection or the launcher itself. I tried to download some of the free games, (Dauntless, Rhyme, or Stories Untold) but to no avail: Where should be the button for getting the game, there was just the word ""Loading"". I re-downloaded the launcher installer, reinstalled it, but nothing happened. The issue remained: I could not access my game library and to get into the store I had to click on the Library, then on ""Shop games and Mods"" (if I do a click on the Store tab, it would do nothing at all) or getting to the store by right - clicking the icon on the Task Bar, near the Network Access and the clock, and then left click on STORE.

Then, on midnight (May 24th), I unistalled the launcher, using the Control Panel (on Windows 7). JUST THE EPIC GAMES LAUNCHER, nothing else. I proceed to reinstall the launcher again and to my SHOCK, I saw some of the games I got were missing: Subnautica (12-14-2018), SuperMeat Boy (12-28-2018), What remains of Edith Finch (01-12-2019), Oxenfree (03-23-2019) and Transistor (04-19-2019). 

I don't know what happened or WHY by unistalling THE LAUNCHER those games I mentioned were also UNISTALLED without a warning or nothing. I know, they were free games that EPIC gave us every two weeks, but I really want some kind of explanation here. I really want to have at least SUBNAUTICA back. I've written to Epic Games support and also on twitter. I will post here the links to the tweets I sent them, along with the screen captures revealing the problems. 

I hope (and beg) some of you can help me with this issue.

I purchased a game from Epic Game Store, didn’t like it, and emailed them for a refund (same day I bought it/less than an hour of gameplay). 


I didn’t hear from anyone for a full week (7 business days). They told me that I’m not eligible for a refund. I quoted them their policy that has been updated in January 2019. 


Still, nothing. 


I asked for a partial refund or store credit for the difference of the game price, since it’s on sale and they won’t refund me when I’m well within their policy. 


I purchased the game with PayPal and I’m thinking of opening a ticket with them. Would you all think Epic would ban me after that? I don’t want to lose all of my other games because Epic won’t stand by their policy. 


A friend of mine did a charge back via his credit card company when he was wrongfully charged for $300 in V-Bucks.

Steam desperately needs competition because the store is an absolute mess. My queue is flooded with shovelware, asset flips, projects made with stolen material, all the games that looked like they were made in someone's garage factory like the stupid picture puzzles, the weeb games, VR games, and many others. Dozens of these getting added to the store every day, and it's getting worse. I constantly see items that have been seen by so few people they barely even have any tags. Then there's all the games that aren't even tagged properly.  


The tagging exclusion system in the queue is completely pointless because it still shows titles with excluded tags if they overlap with tags that you play. This is if steam doesn't decide to arbitrarily remove your excluded tags.  


I've been hoping for an alternative for a while now because it's really frustrating just trying to maintain a wishlist of things I'd like to buy at some point.  


And for the love of god, why can't I exlude games that aren't even in english?

Let’s get something straight here. Tim Sweeney is not a business genius, he is riding on one of those fluke fads that come around every few years. It’s like celebrities that suddenly know everything about how to make the world a better place. He tries to take the moral high ground but fails. He is so patronizing that he makes even the most peaceful person want to punch him in his face. 

He tries to come off as such a swell guy but he’s just another idiot that that thinks he’s smarter than everyone else. I believe that Fortnite money is running down so he’s trying to get Steam to come down on that cut because he’s running an unsustainable model. Valve aren’t going to give this prick the time of day because they don’t need to. What they currently have with Steam works. Valve can’t help it that companies out there prefer their service over others. You don’t see them throwing money at these developers to get them to only sell their product on Steam. When a business has to pay you in order to get your business then something is wrong. Steam doesn’t have a monopoly so I’m not sure why people keep using that term. 

The fad that is Fortnite will die out eventually and Tim Sweeney will be left scrambling because that is the only thing keeping Epic in the race. Instead of trying to buy people’s loyalties, he should instead be focused on making the Epic launcher worth two cents. 

Stop trying to tell other companies how to run their business that has worked for years and instead focus on your own shit show.",Tim Sweeney has a severe mental disability.,,1556369274.0,2019-04-28 12:47:54

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We make decisions based on our ""human logic"" which is more often than not more buggy than a day-one game and takes into consideration them ost mundane and useless bits of things while completely ignoring the core and most important concepts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So let me start off by saying that I am nethirt for nor against Epir or Steam. I play games, regardless of platform. But the recent uproar that Epic has gotten is 95% nitpicking from pissed-off hurr-durr people who are faced with a new kind of store that is not the one store they got oh-so-much used to and they are too ignorant and rooted in one and only one store that they do not want to acknowledge the existence of other platforms and do not bother to adapt to changes, just want everything to be in one place; and even if it just means 3 extra clicks, they get upset that they have to do ""extra work"" and go through ""extra trouble"" to buy/play their games.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have been following this debate for quite some time, and going to dissect the claims from both sides and say what I think about the main ones, just to point out how ridiculous and stupid humans are.

&amp;#x200B;

Picture/list used for comparison: [https://linustechtips.com/main/uploads/monthly\_2019\_02/150400409\_EpicvsSteamfeatures.jpg.82971ea1fab2fb9b390a0b8e81f30245.jpg.2812fbca8e4cb510751bc275cfed025e.jpg](https://linustechtips.com/main/uploads/monthly_2019_02/150400409_EpicvsSteamfeatures.jpg.82971ea1fab2fb9b390a0b8e81f30245.jpg.2812fbca8e4cb510751bc275cfed025e.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

**Account sharing:** can be beneficial, yes, but absolutely not a necessity, why bother?

Achievements: Neat little additions, yes, but as they do not make any difference whatsoever neither on the gameplay nor the customer experience (meaning store support, process of buying, etc.) why do so much people care? I could definitely understand that they are important for some people and even I like getting them, but when it boils down to gameplay experience, they add literally nothing to iit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Broadcasting:** Does anyone use it? I mean there is so much better options for broadcasting/streaming games, such as Twitch or YouTube, which have been in the broadcast/stream business for MUCH more than Stea and to everything better. Steam and Epic are, in their cores, marketplaces, not streaming sites, so it should NOT be a negative or positive if they have one or not.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cloud saves:** This one I admit, is one of the best options Steam has come up with and for that, I am grateful, as I have recently bought a gaming PC and it feels good having my saves transferred. Epic should have it, no questions about it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Forums:** A mixed bag. While it is convenient to have a forum for each game just a click away, it's not like if Steam wouldn't have it, there wouldn't be any others. Gaming forums have existed before Steam, and you can find plenty, here on reddit or on other forums, and if they wouldn't be present on Steam, life would go on as normal, these could be found on webpages all around the www.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gifting:** A neat little feature of which I approve, however, I have never ever used it and still not a negative thing not to have it. Not an experience-breaking thing or anything like that, no negative impact on the customer experience or gaming experience all in all. Beneficial for the store though, as more games get sold this way, so from a business perspective, it would be greatfor Epic to have it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Groups:** Have never used it, don't see the reason why would I use it at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Item trading:** Now, I see some people being really fond of it, but really, what purpose does it serve? Again, there are some game-specific item trading sites even for Steam games, such as for Path of Exile.

&amp;#x200B;

**Library sorting**: Now, this is a good thing to have, especially if you have a shitton of games. I hope Epic will have it in the future when they will have more games, but as of now, it's not that devastating.

&amp;#x200B;

**Linux and MacOs support:** Great to have but considering that the consumer-base consist of 90% PC gamers, not a deal breaker not to have that \~10% supported.

**Mod distribution:** Again, a cool feature through Steam Workshop and all that, but there are dedicated websites for game mods, such as ModDB, so why bother having one in any launcher? Convenient, but not necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offline play:** A BIG NO-NO NOT TO HAVE IT. Epic needs to fix this ASAP, as I know there are people with unstable/slow Internet or sometimes no network access at all for days, and to dany playing the game from them is a shitty move and will turn a lot of them down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Player count data:** More like an index and indication for the store itself than for the players, so why is it even listed there?

&amp;#x200B;

**Regional pricing:** Convenient little feature which should be implemented in Epic as well, as this makes it easier to judge the price of games. Still not mandatory, but a strongly recommended one to have.

&amp;#x200B;

**Screenshot capture/sharing+streaming to other devices:** Same as streaming/broadcasting.

&amp;#x200B;

**User created guides:** handy tools, but IMO they fall into the forums category. Also, it happened to me a lot of times that I found MUCH better guides on other websites than on Steam, so it's a 50-50.

&amp;#x200B;

**User profiles:** It is just an annoying human thing to be obsessed with profiles and having a profile for everything. I do not wish for an account when I shop at a supermarket or a clothes shop, so why would we bother with profiles on a gaming platform (except with multiplayer games, but that's another story)? Are humans really that dumb and obsessed with profiles that it counts as a negative for them?

&amp;#x200B;

**User reviews**: UP UNTIL THIS POINT it was a convenient and useful (elbeit not-so-reliable!) tool to have, but after the review bombing, it practically lost its usefulness (not that I would care about them in the first place when I bought games; not on Steam reviews anyway). Review bombing proved the backlash it could cause and how it can be exploited. And anyways, if you want to see reviews, go onto YouTube or read some well-received gaming magazines' articles. Boom. Done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wish lists:** A neat little addition and a convenient one at that, being immediately informed if something happened to a game on your wish list, it would be nice to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the exclusivity deals... Man, how I hate it. Think about it this way before accusing anyone of ""bribing the devs"" or shit like that. You are a developer (not an AAA like Metro's, but a mediocre or indy or things like that). You have spent YEARS of your life creating a video game and you've sunken millions of $$$ into it probably. You WANT reassurance that you WILL have the revenue (hence the Epic guarantee) to make it back even to square one, not to mention reap profits. You do not want to go bankrupt. Money drives the world and people do things for money as they have to spend money on living their lives. If I was a game dev and would be offered such a deal, I would take it without a second thought and you cannot blame people for wanting not to go bankrupt and wanting to make profits. I had been living with a guy who studies game development for like 15-20 hours a day, he knows his shit and how hard it is to develop a game, so yeah, I completely understand and support devs taking the secure way.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's not like that by going exclusive, the store robs/cuts the game of anything, they are not removing gameplay elements, nor do they change any features. Metro Expdus, for example, is a goddamn good game regardless of platform. It is NOT detrimental to the gameplay, and if you do not play the game for the gameplay, then why the f\*\*\* else would you buy it for the first place?! People forget that GAMING is about the GAME.If you do not buy a game just because it is on another store, you didn't want to buy the game in the first place, nor did you want to support the developers. If you decide not to support the devs just because they have entered a mroe secure deal with another store, there is something wrong with your way of thinking. Imagine being upset that you cannot buy your favorite pudding in Walmart from now on, only in Tesco and being so upset about it that you actually stop buying it. See how stupid itt sounds? Yeah. If it is the platform that makes or breaks a game for you, it wasn't important for you at all for the first place.

1554403712,https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/b9gp7d/concerns_and_the_roadmap_forward/,"**HELLO THERE**
I'm the newest member of the moderation team!  I requested to be a bigger part of this Reddit community because I wanted to see a healthier standing community and promote genuine discussion regarding the Epic Games Store and their available content.  One of my initial concerns when first checking out the subreddit was the amount of toxicity compared to the small subscriber count, and I wanted to sit down with our moderators and current community members to discuss the current and future standing of this subreddit.

**WHAT IS THIS?**
It's pretty obvious that the sheer existence of the Epic Games Store is itself a controversy, perhaps for more legitimate reasons than other.  I should preface this by saying that we don't want non-subscribers looking in and feeling like we're suppressing or censoring opinions, but we also want to uphold civil conversation that doesn't promote attacks and/or being a jerk towards others for no discernible reason.  While you may not support the current array of features, or may have caught wind of an idea/statistic that may not be entirely valid, everyone involved deserves the same respect as any human being.

**THE DISCUSSION OF CONCERNS**
While we work to refine the rules for this community in a way that benefits as many people as possible, one of the proposed ideas currently is to centralize discussions regarding concerns related to the Epic Games Store into a single thread.  A new stickied thread would be periodically refreshed to prevent the clutter of outdated conversation (beginning with this thread).  There *are* concerns and criticism to be had, and we want people to be able to talk about it.

**WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING CONCERNS AND BEING A JERK?**
Good question!  Right now, we generally define being a jerk as blatant attacks or distribution of misguided information.  We can perhaps put together a examples list if requested, but there's no place here for people to belittle other or be malicious.  We also currently won't tolerate any posted torrenting resources in an act of retaliation.

**NOW WHAT?**
During this subreddit ""refresh,"" we highly encourage you to leave feedback (public or private), because this is *everyone's* community, not just the moderator's.  Everything aforementioned is tentative and open to change, and we will let you know when changes are made.",Concerns and the Roadmap Forward,,1554360512.0,2019-04-05 07:48:32
